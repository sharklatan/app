Record Animoji videos with unlimited duration with this standalone app.
This app uses the private AvatarKit framework, the same one that's used by Apple's iMessage app. It leverages ReplayKit's screen recording capabilities to allow for longer recordings than the standard app.

You can also choose to record with or without audio.

Top features:

Record Animoji videos with unlimited duration
Customize the background color
Live stream your Animoji to services like Mobcrush and Periscope
Record Animoji videos without pausing audio playback from other apps (when microphone is disabled)

Karaoke mode

Lip sync to your favorite songs using Karaoke mode. Tap "Configure Karaoke", search for the song you want and select it.
When you press record, the song will automatically start playing and will be recorded with your Animoji video.

Caveats

Make sure your phone is not on silent mode.
Karaoke mode requires a premium Spotify subscription and the Spotify app to be installed on</div>

"For over 6 years, I've been recording 1 second every day, so I'll never forget another day ever again. This project has had such a positive impact on my life. This lead to the development of 1 Second Everyday; which makes it easy for anyone to do this too. Being able to relive every single day has provided me with a treasured perspective on life. It holds me accountable for making each day notable. When I turn 40, I'll have a 1 hour compilation that encapsulates my 30s. If I live to see 80 years of age, I'll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life."

- Cesar Kuriyama, 1SE Founder

Why 1SE is awesome:
- MULTIPLE SNIPPETS: Some days have so much going on, our classic project now allows up to two separate snippets in a day.

- AUTO-SELECT: Don't know how to start? Roll the dice and auto fill your days with ease! 

- ROTATE & FILL THE FRAME: Pesky vertical videos? Begone! Lopsided videos ruining your mash? No more! You can now rotate and fill the frame to your heart's content.

- UNLIMITED MASHING: Make 1SE videos of any custom length. Monthly, seasonal, or the past 5 years. You're in control.

- NOTES: Take note of your day and leave a private message for yourself.

- MOOD: There so many ways to remember your day, now you can remember how you were feeling! Get an at-a-glance view of your mood for the day with our newest tracking feature.

KEY FEATURES
=============================
Keep track of your baby’s mental development
Learn all about the leaps and bounds and the fussy phases of your baby
Read the bestselling Wonder Weeks book here in this app
Take notes about a range of topics


Think of it as a portable, at-a-glance version of the calendar leap chart in The Wonder Weeks. Where the book describes in-depth and easy-to-understand terms the incredible developmental changes your baby goes through, the app is the perfect leap calendar companion to track your baby’s mental development (during the first 20 months). By knowing what is going on inside the head of your baby, you can help him to make the leap more easily and stimulate his development. 

The Wonder Weeks app helps new parents by:   
- Calendar Showing when your baby makes a leap in his mental development 
- What your baby can understand & learn after this mental leap  
- What your baby can do after this leap  
- What you can do to help your baby   

This app is also a handy reminder for new parents when their baby’s brain is changing, or “leaping,” the baby is making a significant advance in mental development, and with each step forward comes a drastic change in the way your baby sees the world around him. Because these leaps come so quickly, the “new world” and new abilities can sometimes be scary, and the development can initially manifest in poor sleep, bad appetite, crying, clinging and crankiness – exhausting and frustrating mom and dad. 

International experts on The Wonder Weeks:  “This is a very practical and entertaining window into the baby’s first year and a half. van de Rijt and Plooij have observed and found the vulnerable times in an infant’s development that I independently came to in my book Touchpoints (Perseus Books Group). The authors’ observations and practical suggestions are wonderful.”  -T. Berry Brazelton, M.D., professor emeritus, Harvard Medical School   

"Anyone who deals with infants and young children will want to read The Wonder Weeks. This book will open parents' eyes to aspects of their children's growth, development, changing behavior, and emotional responsiveness that they might otherwise not notice or find puzzling and distressing."  -Catherine Snow, Ph.D., Shattuck Professor of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education

<div class="item-text">Dark Sky is the most accurate source of hyperlocal weather information. With down-to-the-minute forecasts, you’ll know exactly when the rain will start or stop, right where you’re standing. (It’s like magic.) 

Featured in: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Wired, and more.

YOUR WEATHER, DOWN TO THE MINUTE 
Dark Sky is able to create forecasts for your precise location, giving you minute-by-minute predictions for the next hour and hour-by-hour forecasts for the next day and week.

BEAUTIFUL WEATHER ANIMATIONS 
The same technology that powers Dark Sky’s predictions also allows us to make the world’s first perfectly smooth radar animation. Other apps show you a chunky slideshow that makes it nearly impossible to tell how storms are moving. But Dark Sky’s radar animation lets you see the actual path of the storm: how it moved in the past, and where it’s going in the future. 

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS 
Dark Sky comes with advanced notification options: Receive down-to-the-minute alerts before it starts raining at your exact location, get notified of government severe weather alerts (for such things as thunderstorms, flooding, hurricanes, etc.), or even create your own custom notifications covering the next 24 hours for things like temperature, wind, precipitation and more. Even if you haven’t opened the app in days, Dark Sky will tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it. 

TODAY WIDGET
The Dark Sky Notification Center Widget tells you at a glance what’s going to happen in the next hour and the next week, so you don’t even have to unlock your phone to quickly check the weather before heading out.

TIME MACHINE
Explore weather in the past or future. Choose a date and see historical weather data or future predictions based off of seasonal averages.

APPLE WATCH
Dark Sky looks great on your wrist. Get notifications and check out the weather for the next week with the Dark Sky app built from scratch for Apple Watch.</div>

About AutoSleep
-----------------
Using Advanced Heuristics AutoSleep works out how long you've slept so you don't have to.

If you DO wear your Watch to bed, you don't need to do a single thing. AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning once you unlock your iPhone. 

Even if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.

If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply put your Watch on charge just before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. 

A handy Today Widget lets you see how your own "batteries" are charged for last night and the previous seven days. A second (entirely optional) widget lets you also track the time you have taken to fall asleep.

As everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. 

If you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. 
*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. 

AutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. 

*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 3.2 or higher. WatchOS 4.2 recommended.</div>
