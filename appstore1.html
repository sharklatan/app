</div>
<div class="item-subtitle">V. 1.6.3</div>
<div class="item-text" id="wrestling-revolution-3d-pro_TBAPP">For the first time ever, Wrestling Revolution features BOTH aspects of the business in ONE shared universe - and this special "Pro" edition offers full access to each career with no holds barred! Start anywhere with anyone, and either take shots in the ring as a wrestler or call the shots backstage as a booker - promoting entertaining matches every week for ratings. Seeing each side of the curtain gives you an even better appreciation for the other, and ensures you'll never grow bored of wrestling again!

Your purchase also includes a "Backstage Pass" that allows you to save your changes to all 9 rosters before pitting them against each other in dream matches of your own creation! With 4 pages of rules to mix &amp; match - including up to 20 wrestlers in rings of any shape or size - the only limit is your imagination. You can also blow off steam with no pressure by revisiting the 8 weeks of shows from the game's promotional tour. Not to mention the interactive training process that teaches you how to lock up in the first place.

BASIC CONTROLS
The game features an interactive tutorial that you are advised to play through, but the basic controls are as follows:
CURSORS = Movement (double-tap to dash)
A = Attack (with a direction to aim high, without to aim low)
G = Grapple
R = Run
P = Pick-Up / Drop (with a direction to throw)
T = Taunt / Pin / Referee duties
EYE = Change focus / Turn opponent around
HEALTH METER = Switch character
CLOCK = Pause / Change camera angle

PERFORMANCE
Although every effort has been made to keep performance as high as possible, some devices may benefit from a visit to the Options menu to fine tune the display:
- The number of characters is perhaps the biggest factor so consider turning off referees and setting a limit on the match size.
- If you don't want to sacrifice numbers, you can sacrifice polygons instead and opt for "Basic" character models (no fingers).
- The ropes are surprisingly demanding and you may squeeze in an extra character if you make them "Static".
- Turning off shadows and reducing crowd sprites may also help.</div>

Levels are now multi-tiered! Drive across decayed highway overpasses, via underground tunnels, or smash through epic zombie filled factories. Whichever path you choose to take, you won't be able to escape the zombie hordes - your only choice is to smash through them!
 BUILD A ZOMBIE-SLAUGHTERING MACHINE
Unlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.
 DESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES
Vehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.</div>

You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve landed yourself in prison again, and your only chance is to engineer an escape by any means necessary. How you do it is up to you! Why not cause a prison riot? Or dig a tunnel right under the walls of the prison? Or even steal a guard uniform to blend in with your captors?

The Escapists is a unique prison sandbox experience with lots of items to craft and combine in your daring quest for freedom. Life in prison will keep you on your toes with the strict rules that you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to break. The guards are out to stop any escape attempts, so you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to avoid suspicious behaviour by attending roll calls, working a prison job and hiding your stolen craftables. 
Escaping is what you do best, and you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll have to prove your skills in a variety of challenging prisons from across the world, with new prison, Escape team included in the latest update. Locked in a military prison for crimes they did not commit, the 4 members of the Escape team must work out how to break free from an Escape proof military prison. Maybe the rumours that the compound houses the fiercest tank in history will help?

BADLAND is an award-winning atmospheric side-scrolling action adventure platformer set in a gorgeous forest full of various inhabitants, trees and flowers.

BADLAND takes side-scrollers to the next level with its innovative physics-based gameplay combined with stunning, atmospheric graphics and audio.

BADLAND also features a highly original local multiplayer mode for up to four players on the same device, where the name of the game is survival of the fittest with no rules. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s totally OK to push your rivals in front of spinning circular saws to survive.

Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dire future.

As the overwhelming despair of this new world surrounds you, how will you survive? Your approach to the countless moral choices you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be faced with on a daily basis, could be the difference between the lives of your family or their unfortunate end. Resources are scarce though, with barely enough to cling desperately to life for another day you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re already faced with a monumental choice. Who will you send to venture out into the vast unforgiving wasteland? Whilst exploration is a traumatic experience, the weapons you can craft from resources could tip the scales of life or death in your favour. Assaults from feral beasts and roaming factions are endlessly closing in, imminent and deadly risks surround you.
√¢‚Ç¨ÀúViolence is never the answer√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Maybe you once believed that, but combat may now be your only option for survival. As you and your family grow and progress, so do their skills, attributes and weaknesses. Ensure that they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re well equipped as you strategize, securing victory against those who threaten the survival of your family in tense turn based combat.</div>

"Her Story is one of the most entrancing experiences you can hope to find on mobile"
9/10, Pocket Gamer

"It‚Äôs a murder case where you‚Äôre in the detective‚Äôs chair, a mystery where you make the running, and an engrossing experience from start to finish. With this we should consign the term ‚Äúinteractive movie‚Äù to history‚Äôs dustbin, because movies can‚Äôt dream of offering audiences a narrative structure as intimate and involving as this: they‚Äôre just moving pictures. Her Story points to the future" 5/5, The Guardian

Her Story is the critically acclaimed mystery game from Sam Barlow. Playing like an interactive true crime documentary, the game lets you go hands on with a police database full of live action video footage. It stars Viva Seifert, actress and one half of the band Joe Gideon and the Shark.

How does it work?

Her Story sits you in front of a mothballed desktop computer and logs you into a police database. Search through hundreds of video clips that cover seven interviews from 1994 in which a British woman is interviewed about her missing husband. Explore the database by typing search terms, watch the clips where she speaks those words and piece together her story.

A totalitarian State controls every aspect of private and public life. Laws are oppressive. Surveillance is total. Privacy is dead. You are the State-installed manager of an apartment building. Your daily routine involves making the building a sweet spot for tenants, who will come and go.

However, that is simply a facade that hides your real mission.

The State has appointed you to SPY ON YOUR TENANTS! Your primary task is to covertly watch your tenants and eavesdrop on their conversations. You must BUG their apartments while they're away, SEARCH their belongings for whatever can threaten the authority of the State, and PROFILE them for your superiors. You must also REPORT anyone capable of violating the laws or plotting subversive activities against the State to the authorities.

Beholder is all about making choices - choices that matter!
What will you do with the information you collect? Will you report the suspicious activities of a father and orphan his children? Or will you withhold the details about his illegal activities and give him a chance to make things right? You may also choose to blackmail him to acquire the money your family desperately needs.

Features:
- You decide what happens: Every decision you make affects the way the story unfolds.
- People aren't just objects: Each character you meet will have a thoroughly developed personality with his or her own past and present. 
- No decision is easy: If you are given the power to destroy the privacy of another person, should you? Or should you treat those on which you are spying the way they deserve? 
- You don't know where you'll end up: "Beholder" is a game of multiple endings.

<div class="item-text" id="loner_TBAPP">'Loneliness is a kind of beauty, a quiet experience.'
LONER is a very simple game, no attributes, no upgrade, or even no score, what it wants to bring you, is only purely tranquillity and loneliness.
LONER tells the story of a lonely journey of a pilot, in the journey, you would understand his past and his pursuit.

Features
**Unique Game Mode
It has two modes of operation, two-hand-sliding and gravity sensing, the unique design brings a deeper sense of immersion.
**Very Simple but Various Pictures
There is no complicated shape and brilliant appearance, but you would set foot on a different kind of color trip.
**The Right Original Music
Several sad, or quiet background music makes you completely immerse in the game.
**Random and Rich Barriers
Level barriers are completely random and there is the strong vs strong level. It takes the different levels of players into account; obstacles are based on the music beat, which deepen your inner resonance.

Director Profile
Before making LONER, I was a game programmer, and really wanted to make a game with my own style. The original idea is to make a 3D version "Flappy Bird" with a different perspective, but in the production process, I suddenly found that the game has a quiet loneliness: A plane flies slowly alone in the dark channel by passing one after another obstacle, but seems never reach the end of channel, which is slight shiny in the distance. In the influence of some literary and artistic works, I have been very interested in loneliness, and there are rarely games which express mainly the lonely sense in the market, so that the game topic is decided as this. 
As a programmer who begins to learn art, I understand that to create roles and environment with rich details in short time is unrealistic, so I decide to pay a tribute to the art style of the "2001: A Space Odyssey‚Äù, and this style features "Loner" that the entire scene tones can be arbitrarily transformed.

Customise your pool table by choosing the color and cloth patterns you like.

In Time Trial you have a time limit of 4 minutes, in which you have to pocket balls as fast as you can to achieve more score. When you pocket more than one ball back to back, your multiplier will increase and which will boost your score and time.

In Matrix Mode, when you pocket a ball your score will be multiplied by the difference of your previous and current ball number if the current is more than the previous; but if the current is less, then your score is divided by the current ball number. So be careful.

Have you ever thought about playing billiards on a real table, Real Pool 3D is the perfect way to try a variety of games. Real life graphics and angles to help improve your skills. Play Practice mode if you just want to relax and play without any rules.

So don‚Äôt let the parrot die for nothing and tell that grumpy old lady that her husband donated organs for a strange woman lying in a pond and that her sister poses nude for some dog.

At any time, you can strap yourself into the cockpit and see how it flies with realistic physics. If you're not in the mood for building, over 50,000 airplanes are available to download for free.

BUILD AIRPLANES
You have the tools you'll need to bring any airplane to life. Snap parts together to build your airplane's body. Place engines to add thrust. Design and attach wings and then strap yourself into the cockpit and see how it flies. 

DOWNLOAD AIRPLANES
Over 50,000 airplanes are available to download for free from SimplePlanes.com. Find anything from old WW2 bombers to next generation fighters to sci-fi spacecraft. You can upload your own airplanes and rise through the ranks from a bronze builder to a gold level builder.

DYNAMIC FLIGHT MODEL
Flight simulation at its finest. Every little change you make in the designer impacts how the airplane flies. Weight distribution, thrust, lift, and drag are all calculated continuously while flying. Parts can break off in spectacular fashion while flying due to over-stress or by hitting something. The fun won't stop there though. You can keep on flying even with a missing wing if you've got the skills.

SANDBOX MODE

In the world of OVIVO, Black and White exist in harmony. By constantly intertwining and replacing each other, they maintain balance. The main character named OVO was born of these two halves and has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.

Features:
‚ñ†	Flow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black‚Äîupward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow.

‚ñ†	Fascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions.

‚ñ†	Design without words. There is almost no text in the game and the story is told through gameplay and visuals.

In 1979, a daring journalist sets out to investigate on his own, after continuous disapproval by his editorial department, the famous case of the Hudson Family, a family living in the vicinity of New New Orleans, near the mouth of the Mississippi River. They lived in the time of British America, around the year 1830. They boasted an estate of four hectares where the rich landowner Mr. Benjamin Hudson owned a large number of slaves from the African continent, whom he tortured and raped in numerous occasions, provoking death.
The case never reached the courts since Hudson enjoyed great freedom thanks to the contacts he had previously obtained in political office. Because of this, the journalist James O'Connell must travel to the state of Louisiana, where a difficult task awaits him if he intends to bring to light all the mysteries that may have been hidden for more than a hundred years in that mansion.

<div class="item-text" id="killing-time-at-lightspeed_TBAPP">A critically acclaimed work of interactive fiction, Killing Time at Lightspeed allows players to experience life aboard a spaceship hurtling through lightspeed. Just how much can you affect other people's lives with your fleeting interactions through social media? And will it be for the better?

"It‚Äôs clever for all sorts of reasons, but the most smart aspect is its recognition of your passivity in the role of a visual novel player, and making that the most crucial part of the story is telling."
- John Walker, RockPaperShotgun

"It simultaneously tackles the extremely personal and the tremendously impersonal nature of online communication: you can see the full range of emotions your friends experience, but you can‚Äôt attend their weddings, meet their children, offer them anything but words on a screen."
- James O'Connor, ZAM

"I felt a sense of growing despair each time I hit the ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù button... Killing Time at Lightspeed is, more than anything else, a timely game about technology and the role of social media not just in the future that developer Gritfish has created but in our present reality as well. "
- Javy Gwaltney, Paste Magazine

&#8203;You never know what the last thing you say to someone will be.

On a transport ship leaving earth, a passenger kills time by scrolling through the messages of their social media feed. As the ship leaves and moves further and further away from home, the delay between sending messages and their arrival lengthens. What feels like minutes on the ship is hours, days, weeks, even years back on Earth. Each refresh of the timeline is a tiny window into the past. What will you do in those precious few moments as the lives of everyone you know pass by?

Killing Time at Lightspeed is a complete experience with no in-app purchases whatsoever.</div>

JOURNEY BEYOND THE STARS
Last Voyage is a cosmic adventure through space and mind in 10 unique chapters. Go through psychedelic portals, solve abstract puzzles, explore grand minimal forms or race against the stars. A science-fiction experience unlike any other game.

THE DESIGN
A cinematic game with stunning movie-like graphics, each chapter is visually unique and explores an original concept with completely new game mechanics.

THE MUSIC
60+ minutes of original soundtrack to heighten your sense of wonder. The soundtrack features a variety of genres and has been tailored to every movement on the screen. Best experienced with headphones.

PHILOSOPHY
Last Voyage is a game about space that is not about spaceships but rather what lies beyond our culture and technology. A game where you don't master a single task but rather explore a range of concepts. As a result, the levels are sometimes mysterious, and other times very direct. Sometimes completely still, and other times moving at the speed of light. While these chapters form a continuous narrative, you are constantly surprised with new ways to interact as you seamlessly transition from one chapter to another.</div>

--- Background Story ---
You Died. 
Pure and simple, but death was not the end. You have become an agent of Death: a Reaper. You have the powers of Death, but there are rules in this supernatural afterlife.

The Reaper ends lives, but it cannot control humans directly due to the Free Will Clause. As the Reaper, you must plan and execute your killings by using the environment to your advantage. In the meantime, be wary of Minions of Light, who will try to save humans from their grim fate!

--- Key Features ---
‚óè Isometric ‚ÄòGod‚Äô Perspective
View your hunting grounds from a top-down perspective. Follow the lives of your targets and those out to stop you.

‚óè Non-linear Design
Start with any character you want, and solve the puzzles in any order you like within the limits of the Death Traps and weather conditions.

‚óè Observe, Plan, Execute
Observe the victims to find out their behavior and idiosyncracies. Trigger death traps at the right moment to kill efficiently. The better you know their routines, the better you can prepare your death traps.

‚óè Reactive AII
Victims will hang around spots they like and will change their actions and behavior when something happens to them, such as seeing someone die.

‚óè A Morbid Sense of Humor
From suburbia to missile factories, there‚Äôs always a wacky way to wreak havoc. Don‚Äôt be afraid to laugh at someone‚Äôs demise. If you do what you love (in this case, harvesting souls), you'll never have to work a day in your life!

"Without a doubt a graveyard smash" - Keen Gamer: 8/10

Featured in App Store section "New Games We Love".

Top 100 of App Store games in 15 countries!


The Gameplay

Gameplay is similar to old games like Maniac Mansion, Zac McKraken, Beneath A Steel Sky and Monkey Island, but the game has a unique interface that is optimized for touch. Unlike most other point-and-click adventures the player actually holds the current item in his hand.


The Graphics

All handcrafted pixel art.


The Music

All game music only uses original Commodore C64 SID chip sounds, but polyphonic and with professional effects. The main theme of the Paul Pixel game was composed by the Pixel Lover Orchestra and is called "They Want To Get Us". Other chiptune highlights are "The Awakening" by the underground duo Retro Arcade Boys and "The Giant Meteor" by 8-Bit Factory.


The Story

An average guy called Paul Pixel discovers that the part of the city where he lives was put in quarantine. Apparently there has been a zombie outbreak. He needs to get out...

Of course, a short time later he needs to save the whole earth from this zombie apocalypse.

Mysteries and clues await everywhere in Year Walk, but to fully understand the events that took place on that cold New Year's Eve, you will have to delve deeper than the adventure and lose yourself between fact and fiction.

It's a thrilling adventure based on the best-selling Gamewright board game.

Forbidden Island was the secluded retreat of an ancient mystical empire known as the Archeans. Legend has it that the Archeans possessed the ability to control the Earth's elements - fire, wind, water, and earth - through four sacred treasures: The Crystal of Fire, The Statue of the Wind, The Ocean's Chalice, and The Earth Stone. Because of their potential to cause catastrophic damage if they fell into enemy hands, the Archeans kept the treasures secretly hidden on Forbidden Island and designed it to sink if intruders ever attempted to claim them. In the centuries since the mysterious collapse of their empire, Forbidden Island remained undiscovered ... until now.

Will your team be the first to breach its borders, capture the treasures, and make it out alive?

Awarded as Mensa Select in 2010 and nominated for the prestigious Spiel des Jahres award in 2011, Forbidden Island is a fantastic game that's fun and engaging for all who play.

<div class="item-text" id="text-maze-2-whole-new-world_TBAPP">Text Maze 2 is a great retro game invoking all the fun of the old Apple II games. Like its predecessor the levels are made completely of text characters. Unlike the original version, this version includes an entire world complete with various characters and monsters to interact with. There is a castle, a dungeon, towns and even some other special locations to explore. This game relies on the touch interface for everything, including combat. 

Not only is it a complete world, you can interact with it in many ways. You can simply explore. You can meet people. You can fight monsters. If that wasn't enough, it is possible to destroy walls to make your own way.

If you are unsure of an item on the map, simply touch it and its description will show up. To attack, simply put the game into attack mode and touch where you want to hit. The game includes ranged weapons - including a bombs. 

If this wasn't enough to explore, each new game presents entirely random maps to explore. So, if you happen to beat the game once, you can start again for a new experience.

Some features of the game include:

* An overhead map
* The outdoor map wraps around to simulate a globe
* A reputation system that rewards you for good deeds
* Sound effects
* Basic Ray tracing
* Cool Retro graphics
* Authentic Apple II green screen look
* Unlimited replay-ability</div>

Ships are more realistic in which weapon compliments they can carry, and ship control is more intuitive. Battle Fleet 2 also now features Fog of War, allowing for stealth tactics and surprise attacks to be a viable strategy as well as adding the importance of using ships and aircraft for recon as well as attacks. With a full featured campaign and a variety of single play scenarios, Battle Fleet 2 will keep even the saltiest of sea-dogs satisfied. 

Feature List

- Use small caliber guns to pinpoint your shot and switch to devastating salvo mode, forcing all available guns to fire at the same location. 
- Equip your ships with a wide variety of weapons including AA guns, torpedoes, and different caliber naval artillery. 
- Utilize or neutralize bombers and recon planes launched from island bases, aircraft carriers, or cruisers. 
- Assign captains to each ship to determine the ship's turn order

Set off on a crazy journey to solve the surreal puzzles of Homo Machina and learn about the internal working of the human body, represented as a gigantic 1920s factory.

In this narrative puzzle, players are plunged into an ingenious system of nerves, vessels and valves. The aim is to help the body function correctly in about thirty steps or so throughout the entire day. Each scene breaks down daily acts, such as opening your eyes, chewing a toast or listening to music, through seamless navigation and intuitive and inventive gameplay.

Fritz Kahn, a pioneer of infographics and popular science, came up with easy to understand analogies to enable people to improve their understanding of the human body. By combining old school design with a contemporary influence, Homo Machina delights with its clever dialogue between the absent-minded director at the helm of the body-machine and Josiane, his diligent secretary, encouraging players to put to task the armada of workers to get the incredible factory up and running. 

After Californium, Homo Machina is the new video game created by Darjeeling production. It was edited and co-produced by ARTE, European culture digital and TV channel, and Feierabend.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="g30_TBAPP">G30 ‚Äì A Memory Maze is a unique and minimalistic take on the puzzle genre, where each level is hand-crafted and meaningful. It‚Äôs a story of a person with a cognitive disorder, who is trying to recollect the elusive past ‚Äì before the disease takes over and everything will fade away.

How would you feel, if you couldn‚Äôt recognise your life, your loved ones and even yourself? Could you find a light in the dark maze of human consciousness? Could you remember the story?

INNOVATIVE PUZZLES THAT ARE THE STORY

Each level sparks a little memory of the person‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs a two-part puzzle: a visual image of the memory and a telescopic text, that reveals itself with every step. You start with fragmented pieces of the picture attached to dashed lines. Dragging them like strings, you move parts of the image to restore it. In turn telescopic text reacts to your every step ‚Äì the closer you are to the solution, the more text unfolds. And if you're not moving in the right direction, the story piece too can drift away from the truth. You are indeed remembering ‚Äì adding details to the memory and forming a clear picture.

RELAXING AND ATMOSPHERIC

The game has a delightful relaxing flow with atmospheric music and haptic feedback - all this helps you to dive into this compelling story even more. No scores, no timers, no "game over".

A DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS STORY

G30 is about memory and consciousness ‚Äì and what they mean for a human being. There are people around who are losing their ability to remember ‚Äì some kinds of mental diseases do that to a person. G30 shows how they see the world, how they feel about the past they can‚Äôt remember and the reality they can‚Äôt recognize.

Reviews

Review Best Apps - 'Neat and clean with extremely good graphics'
148 Apps - 'A gripping storyline and a deep combat system'
Touch Arcade - 'Looks pretty sweet'

Key Features:
Epic blend of fantasy adventure and action
A deep combat system using intuitive touch controls
Epic boss fights and cinematic sequences
High end visual graphics
Engaging story

Story:
‚ÄúYears after the first war of the deities, in the torn lands of Khunirath, the once glorious warlords of the army of light were now lone mercenaries wandering the kingdoms in search for opportunities to practice their fading skills and survive. Conflict and chaos ruled the realms and the ashes of the first war turned into occasional fires between the humans and the Deevs that looked for opportunities to conquer the realms.

The story of Epic of Kings follows the journey of one of the mercenary warlords on his mission where he will face much greater challenges and gets involved in epic adventures in the mythological fantasy world of Khunirath.‚Äù

But looks alone won‚Äôt carry a game ‚Äì the developers listened to fan feedback and improved gameplay throughout. With a new virtual d-pad, dynamic camera, environmental puzzles, traps, and vicious new enemies, Samurai II is brand new experience for hack ‚Äòn‚Äô slash gamers on the go. 

Samurai II sends Daisuke on a quest for revenge across the war-scorched countryside. From a seafaring village to a flying fortress to the legendary Isle of the Dead, the samurai will stop at nothing to hunt down his arch-enemy Orochi. Will he get his Vengeance?

* Between levels, gorgeous anime-style comic panels tell the samurai‚Äôs tale with original hand-drawn artwork.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a puzzle fan, I can‚Äôt stress it enough ‚Äî you need to play this game.‚Äù ‚Äî AppUnwrapper

‚ÄúIt's tough, it's smart, and its minimal art style leaves you with an uncluttered and engaging piece of pocket art.‚Äù ‚Äî Harry Slater, Pocket Gamer

‚ÄúDissembler is one of those puzzle games that just feels good to play around with, but it backs that simple joy with a solid spate of puzzles and gameplay modes.‚Äù ‚Äî Shaun Musgrave, Touch Arcade

Flip pairs of tiles to make matching color groups vanish, but that is where the resemblance to a standard match-three ends. In Dissembler no tiles will drop in to replace the ones you‚Äôve matched: your task is to remove all tiles and leave behind a clean slate. The experience starts simply, leading you gently from basic principles to more complex puzzles, but before long it will require careful planning and lateral thinking.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="one-hour-one-life-for-mobile_TBAPP">This is an adaptation for iOS of the original desktop game by Jason Rohrer. If you have played the original, you will recognize Jason's cute and quirky graphics and sounds, as well as the wonderful premise: rebuilding civilization from scratch, together with other players and across countless generations.

You are born either as a baby to one of the other players, or as a young woman if no suitable mother is found. Every minute of real time is one year in the game and your maximum age is 60 years. A single life is limited, but the things you make during your lifetime are left for your children and grandchildren once you are gone. Try to make life a little bit easier for those who come after you, so your family line will have a chance to prosper for generations to come.

Sometimes you will spawn alone in the wilderness. You need to build a fire to stay warm and trap rabbits to get meat and furs for clothes. A sharp stone may be your best friend in the beginning. Try to find a good spot to settle and grow some food, because other players may soon arrive as your children, and will need to be taken care of until they are grown enough to help you.

Sometimes you will be born in a sprawling city, with farmers, cooks, blacksmiths, shepherds and hunters. There will be clothes and equipment ready for you, prepared by players who may be your grandparents or distant relatives. Maybe you will gather some friends and set out to start a settlement of your own, maybe you will inherit a farm job from your uncle, or maybe you will slay bears and wolves. The choices are endless, but remember: unless you leave the world better after you have lived than when you arrived, you have not really achieved anything.

Every life you play will put you in contact with new players. Some are more experienced than you, some are less. Some will teach you and some will learn from you. Some may even be disruptive to the civilization you are building, and will need to be dealt with accordingly. It will be up to you and your fellow players to shape the world for a brief moment in time, before the following generations take over.

After your game life is over, you can look at your family tree and see how your descendants are doing. You can take pride in each of your younger relatives who survives into adulthood and in each new generation that follows you, knowing that you helped make it happen.</div>

WHERE TRASH IS TREASURE
Raccoons have taken over Donut County with remote-controlled trash-stealing holes. You play as BK, a hole-driving raccoon who swallows up his friends and their homes to earn idiotic prizes. 

When BK falls into one of his own holes, he‚Äôs confronted by his best friend Mira and the residents of Donut County, who are all stuck 999 feet underground‚Ä¶ and they demand answers!

THE HOLE KEEPS GROWING
‚Ä¢ EXPLORE every character‚Äôs home, each with their own unique environment.

Donut County was created by Ben Esposito, designer on What Remains of Edith Finch and The Unfinished Swan. It is the result of six years of solo development, dozens of donuts (for research), and one fateful encounter with a raccoon.</div>

ABOUT THE GAME
Lazaretto is an immersive first-person indie survival horror game that puts players in the shoes of an urban explorer - whose investigation of a creepy abandoned quarantine island turns into a strange, surreal and dangerous adventure. Atmospheric and surreal, Lazaretto offers a glimpse of a bizarre world beyond human consciousness.

It‚Äôs night. You‚Äôre all alone, exploring the terrifying ruins of an abandoned quarantine island. Find and collect mysterious clues along your journey. What happened before this strange island was suddenly closed down? Bits and pieces of forgotten artifacts reveal a dark, dramatic and haunted past. 

This is only the beginning. You discover unsettling, living nightmares far beyond normal. A mysterious, ghostly seance from the past begs for your participation. Connection with this paranormal world leads to a physical manifestation of the subconscious. Fears and anxieties create a surreal world that you must survive if you want to see another day. You begin to wonder which of these worlds is real and more importantly, which one can you survive.</div>

He was changed. A few more steps and he reached his car. Got into the car, he always remembered that trip on the lake with her. It was a good day, even the best in his life... Insert the key into the ignition switch and tapping his foot on the gas pedal, he went home. One day left without her... He was driving forward, the road was almost invisible, and his state was not very good. He wanted to sleep. His eyes closed themselves. He thought that it would be better to call a taxi... Sudden blow, sound of breaking glass. Pinned down, unable to move. He felt like his life was leaving him. But somehow it seemed to him that this was not the end...

<div class="item-text" id="reigns_TBAPP">Sit on the throne as a benevolent (or malevolent) medieval monarch of the modern age and swipe your royal fingers either left or right to impose your will upon the kingdom. Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family‚Äôs dynasty at risk!

Each year of your reign brings another important ‚Äì seemingly random ‚Äì request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.

<div class="item-text" id="text-maze_TBAPP">Text Maze is a great retro game invoking all the fun of the old Apple II games. In this game you explore various levels of a random maze looking for a crown on each level represented by a "*". Each level will become larger and increasing more difficult as you explore. There are several objects you can find to help you on your quest and at least one monster looking to stop you.

Some features of the game include:

* An overhead map
* Sound effects
* Basic Ray tracing
* Cool Retro graphics
* Authentic Apple II green screen look
* Random maps of increasing difficulty
* Unlimited replayability

Thank you for your interest in this game. It's been something I've been playing with since the early 1990's on an old Apple II and Apple IIgs. If there is enough interest I have several upgrades planned in the future.</div>

GOAL: Uncover cards so they can be moved in ascending order to the 4 suit stacks.

SETUP: A standard deck is dealt in 8 cascading stacks.

HOW TO PLAY: Move cards between the 8 cascading stacks and 4 free cells to uncover cards so you can move them up to complete the suit stacks.

A card can be moved to an empty free cell; to the top of another cascading stack with top card of different colour and one higher value; or to one of 4 suit stacks in ascending order from Ace to King. For example, 3 of clubs can be moved to a cascading stack with top card 4 of hearts. Any value card can be moved to an empty free cell or empty cascading stack.

MOVING CARDS: Tapping a card once will move it to a suit stack if a spot is available or to a pile with available higher card of different color. Double-tapping a card will move it to an open free cell. Alternatively, you can simply drag a card to where you want it to go. If an attempted move is not allowed, the card will shake.

NOTES: You can reject a new hand that looks too difficult by clicking New Game again. If you click New Game before moving any cards, the game will not count as a loss. Click Undo to undo one move at a time, or Start Over to undo all moves in the current game.</div>

In the year 2050, the sun unleashed a catastrophic surge of energy into space, a wave of power that would plunge our civilization into chaos for centuries. Though predicted for years by the scientific community, their warnings were ignored by the world leaders that instead squabbled over petty territorial concerns.

When the wave of energy struck the earth, a storm of radioactive particles blanketed the atmosphere in a deadly, carcinogenic fog. The fog killed indiscriminately ‚Ä¶ the young, old, rich and poor all fell in equal measure. Only those that had heeded the warnings and taken shelter in abandoned bunkers were spared. 

When their supplies eventually ran out and these communities were forced to emerge from their shelters, they saw a new world of desolation and chaos. A world in which the laws of civilization had been replaced by the law of the gun. The few areas that still had clean water and arable land were held by ruthless warlords and their armies.

It was in this world that a warrior known only as Raven would emerge. A warrior that would save his people by bending the wasteland to his will. A warrior that would one day become a legend.

- Explore a merciless wasteland in an immersive, first-person view.
- Manage scarce resources such as ammunition, food and medical supplies.
- Brave the dangers of the wasteland and face off against humans, rabid hounds, ghouls and raiders.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="this-is-the-police_TBAPP">Dive into a deep story of corruption, crime and intrigue. Take the role of gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd, and come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack reach his retirement with a nice stack of bills, or will he end up broken ... or worse? 

Manage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage. 

Choose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you‚Äôll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg‚Äôs crime bosses. Sometimes you‚Äôll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box. Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg?

- Your mission is clear: make $500,000 in 180 days before Jack Boyd reaches retirement. How? That‚Äôs up to you!

- Decisions, decisions! This Is the Police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. Whatever you decide, your choices will influence the game ‚Äì and the fate of Jack Boyd.

- The Good, the Bad, and... the Ugly? The Chief of Freeburg's Police Department deals with all kind of people. It is up to you to find the bad guys and decide how to deal with them.

- Carry out your duties. As head of Freeburg PD, Jack deals with all sorts of challenges every day: responding to emergencies, managing his officers, defending the department against City Hall and a corrupt mayor, and much more.

- Solve Investigations and gather evidence against the criminal gangs of Freeburg.

- Deal with the competing powers of the city. Everyone offers you favors, and each one comes at a price.
Rich and fully voiced story: Jack Boyd is portrayed by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem.</div>

"Cytus II" is a music rhythm game created by Rayark Games. It's our fourth rhythm game title, following the footsteps of three global successes, "Cytus", "DEEMO" and "VOEZ". This sequel to "Cytus" brings back the original staff and is a product of hardwork and devotion. 

In the future, humans have redefined internet development and connections. We can now easily sync the real world with the internet world, changing life as we have known for thousands of years. 

In the mega virtual internet space cyTus, there exists a mysterious DJ legend √Üsir. His music has an irresistible charm; people fall madly in love with his music. Rumor has it that every note and beat of his music hits the audiences in 
the depths of their souls. 

One day, √Üsir, who had never shown his face before, suddenly announced that he will be holding the first mega virtual concert ‚Äî‚Äî √Üsir-FEST and will invite a top idol singer and a popular DJ as opening performances. The instant the ticket sales began, an unprecedented rush occurred. Everyone wanted to see √Üsir's real face. 

On the day of the FEST, millions of people were connected to the event. At one hour before the event started, the previous world record for most simultaneous connection was smashed. The whole city was on its feet, waiting for √Üsir to descent from the skies...

A game for every lonely person in the world.

Swinging man is hanging out the world all by himself, with only one rope holding him up. 
Attach him with the one only rope, just like holding up a tiny little hope, never let go. 
Swing all the way up, finding a path to the end, where maybe misery and sadness ends. With a bonus probably?

Unlock the following unknown new worlds and get into new challenges. Obstacles, darkness, loss of gravity, transportals...
Find out what's out there by yourself.

This is not an easy game to play, just as life itself. Wandering the whole lifetime
not knowing where to go? Got confused, sad and lonely? It's time to be by yourself.

But do really take a second thought before trying on this game. No one wants to play solo all the time, is there?

---Beautiful 2D physics.
---9 different worlds to unlock and explore.
---Darkness, transportals, loss of gravity...
---For maximum awesome headphones recommended
---Game Center achievements

----- WHO AM I?

Games were always my escape from the sad reality. But playing games wasn‚Äôt enough for me and I wanted something more. I wanted to make games.

With that in mind, I started my career as a software developer in 2007 and after 2 years of saving I bought my MacBook Pro and iPhone 3GS with a plan to make games in my free time. In 2010 I moved from Poland to Canada to start a new life with my wife, but my dream about making games hasn‚Äôt changed. Now, many iPhones later, after many projects and hours spent, my first game that I developed on the same old MacBook, is finally out.

My initial goal was to make something simple and quick. That wasn‚Äôt me. It took me over a year but it became my most personal game with a meaning behind every single detail. Now when I see other people playing the game and their reactions when solving the puzzles they struggled with, I know it was worth it.

Who knows, maybe my game will inspire someone somewhere out there to became a developer as well. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs worth doing!

The Fifo want nothing more than to get back to their old life and return to the peace of the meta-space. But they need to find all the parts for a new ark ship. Can you help the Fifo people to find the parts of the ark ship? Only then they can return to their eternal journey through the meta-space.</div>

Featured in: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Wired, and more.

YOUR WEATHER, DOWN TO THE MINUTE 
Dark Sky is able to create forecasts for your precise location, giving you minute-by-minute predictions for the next hour and hour-by-hour forecasts for the next day and week.

BEAUTIFUL WEATHER ANIMATIONS 
The same technology that powers Dark Sky‚Äôs predictions also allows us to make the world‚Äôs first perfectly smooth radar animation. Other apps show you a chunky slideshow that makes it nearly impossible to tell how storms are moving. But Dark Sky‚Äôs radar animation lets you see the actual path of the storm: how it moved in the past, and where it‚Äôs going in the future. 

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS 
Dark Sky comes with advanced notification options: Receive down-to-the-minute alerts before it starts raining at your exact location, get notified of government severe weather alerts (for such things as thunderstorms, flooding, hurricanes, etc.), or even create your own custom notifications covering the next 24 hours for things like temperature, wind, precipitation and more. Even if you haven‚Äôt opened the app in days, Dark Sky will tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it. 

TODAY WIDGET
The Dark Sky Notification Center Widget tells you at a glance what‚Äôs going to happen in the next hour and the next week, so you don‚Äôt even have to unlock your phone to quickly check the weather before heading out.

TIME MACHINE
Explore weather in the past or future. Choose a date and see historical weather data or future predictions based off of seasonal averages.

KEY FEATURES
=============================
Keep track of your baby‚Äôs mental development
Learn all about the leaps and bounds and the fussy phases of your baby
Read the bestselling Wonder Weeks book here in this app
Take notes about a range of topics


Think of it as a portable, at-a-glance version of the calendar leap chart in The Wonder Weeks. Where the book describes in-depth and easy-to-understand terms the incredible developmental changes your baby goes through, the app is the perfect leap calendar companion to track your baby‚Äôs mental development (during the first 20 months).‚Ä®By knowing what is going on inside the head of your baby, you can help him to make the leap more easily and stimulate his development. 

The Wonder Weeks app helps new parents by:‚Ä® ‚Ä®
- Calendar Showing when your baby makes a leap in his mental development‚Ä®
- What your baby can understand &amp; learn after this mental leap‚Ä® 
- What your baby can do after this leap‚Ä® 
- What you can do to help your baby‚Ä® ‚Ä®

This app is also a handy reminder for new parents when their baby‚Äôs brain is changing, or ‚Äúleaping,‚Äù the baby is making a significant advance in mental development, and with each step forward comes a drastic change in the way your baby sees the world around him. Because these leaps come so quickly, the ‚Äúnew world‚Äù and new abilities can sometimes be scary, and the development can initially manifest in poor sleep, bad appetite, crying, clinging and crankiness ‚Äì exhausting and frustrating mom and dad.‚Ä®

International experts on The Wonder Weeks:‚Ä® ‚ÄúThis is a very practical and entertaining window into the baby‚Äôs first year and a half. van de Rijt and Plooij have observed and found the vulnerable times in an infant‚Äôs development that I independently came to in my book Touchpoints (Perseus Books Group). The authors‚Äô observations and practical suggestions are wonderful.‚Äù‚Ä® -T. Berry Brazelton, M.D., professor emeritus, Harvard Medical School‚Ä® ‚Ä®

"Anyone who deals with infants and young children will want to read The Wonder Weeks. This book will open parents' eyes to aspects of their children's growth, development, changing behavior, and emotional responsiveness that they might otherwise not notice or find puzzling and distressing."‚Ä® -Catherine Snow, Ph.D., Shattuck Professor of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education‚Ä® ‚Ä®

About AutoSleep
-----------------
Using Advanced Heuristics AutoSleep works out how long you've slept so you don't have to.

If you DO wear your Watch to bed, you don't need to do a single thing. AutoSleep will track your sleep &amp; quality and send you a notification in the morning.

Even if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.

If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. 

As everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. 

If you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. 
*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. 

AutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart &amp; activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. 

*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher. WatchOS 5 recommended.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="tonalenergy-tuner-metronome_TBAPP">For musicians from pros to beginners, whether you sing, play a brass, woodwind or stringed instrument or any type of guitar, this app provides a set of feature-rich practice tools that gives fun and rewarding feedback.

So what makes the TonalEnergy the best selling music practice app?

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs easy to use. Options like the Target Tuner or Pitch Tracker are on all the main pages.  TonalEnergy helps users create rewarding and attainable goals during a rehearsal or when working alone. Colorful analysis data pages and audio/video recording features enhance the experience of practice.  

‚Ä¢ The metronome is cutting edge. It offers unmatched flexibility in sound choices, tempo settings, meters, subdivision patterns and visual displays. Voice count-ins, the ability to create and edit preset groups and Ableton link for syncing multiple devices make this a superior tool for performers. 

‚Ä¢ Ear training possibilities are endless. The high quality multi-sampled instrument sounds for symphonic instruments are unique among all other tuning applications. Listening skills can be developed through the use of the eight-octave keyboard, chromatic wheel and tone generator. There are no other sounds like these. 

‚Ä¢ Learning is a social activity. Using features unique to the TonalEnergy Tuner, data can be collected, reviewed, edited and shared with others. Feedback is essential for growing and developing great performers. It‚Äôs all about connectivity.

Chris Coletti, member of The Canadian Brass, sums up TonalEnergy by saying,

      ‚ÄúTonalEnergy is a must-have for any serious musician. It's a full suite of tools in one app; the tuner, tone generator, recorder, metronome and beautiful interface make it one of the best tools for musicians out there, period.‚Äù

<div class="item-text" id="superimpose_TBAPP">Just with a few taps, create professional grade superimposed or juxtaposed photos on your iPhone! You don't need a computers and expensive software to superimpose or blend/mix/combine/cut/copy/paste one photo on top of another any more.

Here is how it works...

1. Load a background image.
2. Load a foreground image.
3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.
4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.
5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.
6. Adjust the colors/exposure/contrast/hue/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.
7. You are done! Save the blended image to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.

You can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.

Masking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, polygon, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear, radial gradient, mask from image, mask from text, magic mask and hair refine masking tools. Mask an area with this tool and that area of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.

You can even drop a shadow of the foreground onto the background.</div>

App Store App of the Day for Fri, Dec 22, 2017

It's 1984, and you've got a camcorder! It'll look that way when you record and send old, messed up-looking videos to friends. They'll swear you built a time machine: "OMG, how'd you shoot that?"

With VHS Camcorder, you'll make home movies that look and sound like video tapes pulled out of storage after 30 years. You can change the on-screen date to trick your friends, create flashing cheesy custom titles, mess up the picture by shaking your device and use the zoom lens feature to emphasize those truly embarrassing moments!

"That's freakin' amazing!" -Everyone

Here's Why You Need It:

‚Ä¢ Four words: Best. Throwback. Videos. Ever.

‚Ä¢ The only app you should ever consider to capture your 80s and 90s-themed parties
‚Ä¢ Make your kids' incredibly boring school plays actually watchable

And Also Because of This:

‚Ä¢ Realism: the ORIGINAL and BEST app for simulating old videotape recordings
‚Ä¢ Change the on-screen date so people think you're way younger--or older--than you really are
‚Ä¢ Create custom F*L*A*S*H*I*N*G titles for the ultimate in on-screen cheese
‚Ä¢ Phony zoom lens feature dramatically enhances the cheese factor
‚Ä¢ Mess up the picture during recording using your finger or by shaking your device
‚Ä¢ Don't think we forgot to make things sound bad--we didn't
‚Ä¢ Widescreen recording option (but would you REALLY want to use it?)

<div class="item-subtitle">V. 3.8.4</div>
<div class="item-text" id="things-3_TBAPP">*** APPLE DESIGN AWARD WINNER 2017 ***

Meet the all-new Things! A complete rethinking of the original, award-winning task manager ‚Äì with a perfect balance between simplicity and power, incredible new features, delightful interactions, and a timeless new design.


HERE'S HOW THINGS WORKS

If you're new to Things, this is the basic workflow:

1. Collect Your Thoughts
Get things off your mind quickly with Things‚Äô action extension ‚Äì it lets you create to-dos from other apps. Or just talk to Siri on any device (‚ÄúRemind me to...‚Äù) and import from Reminders.

2. Get Organized
Create a project for each of your goals, then add the steps to reach them. For clarity, add structure with headings. Then group your projects by areas of responsibility, such as ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù, ‚ÄúWork‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHealth‚Äù. Review these regularly to stay on top of things.

3. Plan Your Time
See your calendar events alongside your to-dos and plan your time effectively. Create repeating to-dos for things you do every few days, weeks, or months ‚Äì Things will remind you on the right day.

4. Make the Most of Your Day
Every morning, grab a coffee and prepare your list for ‚ÄúToday‚Äù: review previously planned to-dos and make quick decisions on what to tackle. Pick some more steps from your projects and then get going. The Today list is the only place you‚Äôll need to look for the rest of the day.

5. Customize Your Workflow
Use tags to categorize your to-dos or add context. For example, tag places like ‚ÄúOffice‚Äù or ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, or tag all your ‚ÄúErrands‚Äù, or everything you‚Äôre working on with ‚ÄúKate‚Äù. You can easily find everything you‚Äôve tagged via filtering or search.


HERE'S WHY WE THINK YOU'LL LOVE THINGS

1. It stays out of your way.
As you start using Things, you‚Äôll quickly notice how seamlessly all the features fit together to give you an uncluttered, focused experience. There are no unnecessary frills. No pointless gimmicks or useless controls. In fact, you‚Äôll hardly notice the app ‚Äì it‚Äôs just you and your to-dos.

2. Everything revolves around your to-dos.
In Things, each of your to-dos are special. In a list, they simply show a checkbox and the title of your to-do. But when you open them, they extend into a beautiful white piece of paper that‚Äôs ready to hold your thoughts. Additional details (checklists, tags, reminders, deadline) are nicely tucked away in the corner until you need them.

3. It‚Äôs got a touch of magic.
Things removes friction in magical ways. Take the new Magic Plus Button that lets you insert to-dos at any place in a list ‚Äì simply via drag and drop. Or the ease at which you can multi-select and operate on many to-dos at once. Or the natural language date parser: just type ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù, ‚Äúin 4 days", or ‚Äúnext Wednesday", and it will jump to all the right conclusions.

4. It‚Äôs got all the power of iOS.
Things is fully integrated with all the latest iOS technologies: Apple Watch, Calendars, Siri &amp; Reminders, Today Widget, Quick Actions, Action Extension, Handoff, and Notifications.

5. And much more...
Everyone's got their favorite feature, it's impossible to list them all. See what our users love about Things ‚Äì visit our website at: thingsapp.com


WHAT‚ÄôS NEW?

This is a truly incredible update, with dozens of powerful new features. See the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New‚Äù section below for a full list.


THINGS FOR ALL YOUR DEVICES

Get Things for Mac and iPad to enjoy the full power of Things across your devices (sold separately). The apps all stay updated via Things Cloud ‚Äì the push sync service that we custom-built for Things.


QUESTIONS?

If you have any questions, or run into any trouble ‚Äì please contact us. We provide world-class, professional support for Things, and we‚Äôll be glad to help you.</div>

Welcome to Toca Lab: Elements! Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. 

Discover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! 

* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.
* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. 
* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! 
* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.
* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.

Each element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? 

The time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!

Toca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it‚Äôs a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science. Toca Lab: Elements is just a starting point for further exploration!

<div class="item-subtitle">V. 2.0.44</div>
<div class="item-text" id="ankimobile-flashcards_TBAPP">AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.

AnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:

- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.
- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.
- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.
- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.
- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.
- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.
- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.
- Support for displaying mathematical equations that were added with LaTeX in the desktop software, and ruby text above Asian languages.

Please note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.

Please also note that while you can use almost any language on your cards, AnkiMobile's user interface is only available in English at the moment.

Aside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.

Like all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see http://www.apple.com/itunes/education/

How many times have you tried to capture artful images with your iPhone camera but were left wishing you had more features to work with? Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.
 
Slow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:
 
MOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.

LIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!

LOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!

Highlights:

‚Ä¢  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO
‚Ä¢  Option to resume capture 
‚Ä¢  Real time live preview - See the result in real time
‚Ä¢  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‚ÄòBlur Strength‚Äô controls
‚Ä¢  Tap to adjust focus/exposure
‚Ä¢  Time-lapse Intervalometer
‚Ä¢  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer 
‚Ä¢  Full resolution support on every devices

With Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go. Download it now and put an end to mere snapshots!

<div class="item-text" id="heartwatch-heart-activity_TBAPP">"HeartWatch is so good, you‚Äôd think Apple built the app itself." John Patrick Pullen, Time Magazine. Top 5 in Health &amp; Fitness in 63 countries. 

-----------------------------------------------------
*IMPORTANT* 
HeartWatch 3 requires iOS 10 or iOS 11. Watch OS 3 or Watch OS 4.
If you are missing the Watch App or Experiencing crash on restart, please press the Review tab and click on App Support. This explains what you need to do! Please email us if you are stuck. We love to help. 
-----------------------------------------------------

Your Apple Watch is a highly sophisticated instrument, measuring and capturing your heart rate data throughout the day.

HeartWatch lets you see how your heart is beating across four simple views. Waking, Regular, Workout &amp; Sleeping. Each of these views are isolated because, while you may want a higher heart rate during a workout, if your heart is racing when you aren't doing any exercise then this is likely not a good thing and probably something you might want to show your medical practitioner. 

HeartWatch gives you an easy solution to this. It accesses your heart rate &amp; workout readings created by your Apple Watch and unlocks the power of this information in a simple, intuitive way. 

INTRODUCING HEART BADGES
HeartWatch 2 introduces heart badges. These are a simple glanceable graphic that lets you quickly see how your heart is doing for different types of events. The colours represent time in zones overlayed with an average. 

For regular* heart rate readings, the ideal is to have a completely blue badge. The bigger the red ring around the badge, the more time spent with an elevated heart rate. Even though averages can appear to be similar, the badge shows a clear picture of how your heart has really been tracking and alerts you about excessively high or low readings. 

For workouts, you can easily see the zonal makeup of your workout at a glance.

*regular: time spent not sleeping nor working out.

AN INTELLIGENT COMPLICATION
The complication displays the last heart rate reading captured by your watch. 

A FAST, EASY TO USE WATCH APP
An instant background update has you seeing your latest heart rate and a summary of your day. You can take your "live" pulse at any time by tapping the Pulse gauge. You can start a workout directly in the app and get live updates on your heart rate zone. You can also track sleep and add measurements &amp; notes. 

AMAZING NAVIGATION
Whether you are looking for heart rate irregularities or checking on your workout progress, HeartWatch makes things very easy via a 12 week big picture. Find out exactly what your heart was doing throughout your day. The addition of an energy overlay to the regular heart rate detail view means you can determine if those peaks you sometimes get are more likely due to stress or increased activity. 

CAPTURE HEALTH &amp; SLEEP DATA
Capture key HealthKit measurements just by saying them, take notes about your day and track sleep.

NOTIFICATIONS
You can configure notifications for the following scenarios. 
 - When heart rate exceeds a bpm value. 
 - When heart rate drops below a bpm value. 
 - A daily reminder to check how you've gone today. 

NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR HEALTH
Heart Watch is very useful tool to get alerted about any possible health issues in a concise format that you can show your medical practitioner.

REQUIREMENTS
This app requires an iPhone that has the Health App installed. Heart readings are read from the Health Data Store which is ideally populated by your Apple Watch. You can also import heart rate readings from other sources and devices.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="white-noise_TBAPP">Do you have trouble going to sleep?  Are you traveling on a plane and need a quick power nap?  Does your newborn baby wake up in the middle of the night?  There are numerous benefits to using White Noise:

‚Ä¢ Pacifies fussy and crying babies
‚Ä¢ Increases focus while enhancing privacy

<div class="item-text" id="monash-university-fodmap-diet_TBAPP">Researchers at Monash University have developed&nbsp;the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of&nbsp;gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable&nbsp;bowel&nbsp;syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75%&nbsp;of people with IBS experience&nbsp;symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.

The app comes directly from the research team at Monash&nbsp;and includes the following:

- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.
- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.
- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a&nbsp;simple 'traffic light system'. 
- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.
- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.
- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods
- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten,&nbsp;IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.
- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="northern-lights-photo-taker_TBAPP">This app only does one thing and that's to help you take better photos of the aurora borealis, aka the northern lights.

Here's the scenario - so you see the northern lights (!! - awesome for you, by the way), but you don't have a fancy digital camera with you.  Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  

OK!  Now what??

Do you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do! Enable manual mode; set the focus to infinity; change the temperature to a certain number; change the ISO between certain values; change the shutter speed to something else....wait what...?

Don't worry, this app does all of that for you so all you have to do is find those lights.  ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!

Worth a shot ! (hah..a...was funny when this was typed...)</div>

<div class="item-text" id="ketodiet_TBAPP">KetoDiet App the original low-carb app from KetoDietApp.com

KetoDiet is not just about losing weight at any cost; it's about adopting a healthier lifestyle. Apart from reducing your carbohydrate intake, you will learn why it‚Äôs important to follow a whole foods based approach and include healthy fat sources like olive oil, fatty fish and pastured meat in your everyday diet. 

A healthy low-carb diet is an effective weight loss tool as it will keep your blood sugar level stable and your appetite under control. Apart from fat burning effects, a low-carbohydrate lifestyle can additionally improve health conditions including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and inflammation, all of which increase the risk of developing heart disease. 

The ketogenic diet appears to be useful adjuvant to treatment for health conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type 2 Diabetes, epilepsy and even some types of cancer.

HOW IS KETODIET BETTER THAN OTHER APPS?

1. No subscription fee. You only pay once and everything is included.

2. Free content added daily including recipes, articles, expert advice and more.

3. Accuracy is crucial for a low-carb diet. For that reason, we don't crowdsource nutritional data. All nutritional data in KetoDiet are based on accurate, verifiable sources, rather than user-generated contributions or other unreliable sources.

4. We keep your data private - KetoDiet is not a free app in exchange for your data.

MORE THAN JUST AN APP...

KetoDietApp.com is one the top low-carb websites. More than two million people visit us every month. 

- Thousands have already joined our KetoDiet Challenges to stay motivated while following a healthy low carb diet.
- Facebook support group to help you get started and answer any questions you may have.

WHAT IS KETO?

When you follow a ketogenic diet by reducing your carb intake to less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body will start producing ketones in the liver. You will enter ketosis and start using fat and ketone bodies as energy source. One of the main benefits of ketosis is its ability to suppress appetite. While your ketone levels will increase, your blood glucose levels and insulin levels will drop, leading to satiety. You will naturally eat less and the number of calories eaten will drop.

1. Does it offer over 3,400 questions?  Our app contains thousands more than some other apps.  You don't have to study all 3,400+ questions but they are there for you if you want.  
2. CAN YOU GRADE YOURSELF?  Seriously!  Many board apps don't even allow you to grade yourself.  You can't look at your test scores for each subject because they don't even keep score.
3. Does it have an advanced learn engine that tracks questions seen/unseen, answered correctly/incorrectly, and then dynamically creates your tests accordingly?
4. Does it provide BOTH a casual study mode AND a test mode?
5. Does it provide AUDIO questions?
6. Are you able to SEE your study and test PROGRESS for ALL lessons at a MERE GLANCE?
8. Can you customize your tests with adjustable question counts and subjects?
9. Does it allow you to add your own unit study documents and files to the app?  Most units have unique study requirements such as unit history.  This app allows you to easily add those documents directly into the app.

This is a comprehensive guide addressing the common Army promotion board topics - over 40 subjects. Information was taken directly from Army regulations, Army doctrine reference publications (ADRPs), Army doctrine publications (ADPs), field manuals, technical manuals, training circulars, and pamphlets.

The green screen effect works by combining images from multiple sources into a single video. These images can come from photos or videos in your camera roll, or from the live video camera.

WE NOW HAVE OVER 3700+ VERIFIED PENNY ITEMS AND COUNTING!

Join the THOUSANDS of other Penny Finders!

Penny Finder crowdsources information from our users and catalogs items into a database...AKA we put them in a nice searchable table!  You can:

-  Scan a barcode and the app will tell you if an item is a penny based on other user's discoveries (This app is not a Price Scanner, it's a Penny Scanner)

-  OFFLINE MODE:  Our app will still work even if you have no internet, just make sure you have downloaded the list at least once.

-  Add your own Penny Items to the list using our Penny Scanner!

-  Post your amazing finds on our Haul Wall!

-  Most Recent Penny Finds are highlighted in green and at the top

-  You can flag penny items that you know are full price to have them removed.

-  You can add Penny Items to your favorites for quick viewing later.

WHAT WE ASSUME YOU KNOW BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD:
We assume that you know what penny items are.
We assume you know what store this app is for.
We assume that you know that UPC codes are very important and critical to finding the correct penny items.  (you shouldn't penny shop based off only images).

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE STORES YOU VISIT WILL HAVE PENNY ITEMS.

THIS APP IS NOT A PRICE SCANNER, it's a Penny Scanner.

***The Penny Scanner's performance is based on the frame rate of your camera on your device.  (Which means older devices such as an iPhone 4S and older model iPods/iPads will scan slower using the Penny Scanner than new devices that have considerably better cameras.)

Reviews:

‚Ä¢ I'm a nutrition coach and I tell all of my clients to get this app if they need food ideas. It is a fantastic resource to expand your pallet and to make fat loss taste good. Combine the workouts and recipe sections and you've essentially got yourself a coach. Great app. In my opinion it is under priced for the value that you get!

‚Ä¢ This app is absolutely perfect for anyone!! From either a total beginner just wanting to get started right through to someone looking to get in serious shape. I upgraded from Gymster lite as soon as it was released. As a bikini competitor Gymster recipes give me all I need for a productive off season and a lot of variety and colour to my meals. The macros are all broken down which saves me a huge amount of time. I also use this app to track my workouts and have them pre loaded in. The random selection tool is also great for those days when you just aren't feeling it!! Can't recommend enough

‚Ä¢ I'm finishing my year of personal training at my gym and this is the best app for someone like me to learn and keep track of my workouts. Thanks to Bert Kreischer for the heads up on his podcast.


‚Ä¢ I've used a few gym apps in the past, but this is undoubtedly the best! The reason for that is the 'random' selection for workouts-input body part(s) and the amount of exercises, and away you go! Gives me a fresh workout every time!</div>

<div class="item-text" id="kipkam_TBAPP">How was your day today? Did you have any trouble?
1 minute a day. Invest it to the 'Deep Breathe Exercise' that will calm down you body and mind.

Stress occurs regardless of place and time in the modern society.
When you feel stuffy, start KipKam and try breathing deeply.
A proper breathing is effective in soothing your stress.
Deep breathing actually activates the parasympathetic nerve and calms down your body.

In addition, it is good for reinforcing lung function, activating blood circulation, and treating constipation.


+Basic Usage and Main Functions+
You can control the inhale, pause, exhale time in SETTINGS
You can turn on/off background sound and metronome in SETTINGS.
Background sound insulates you from the surrounding noise, helping to concentrate on breathing.

+Suggestions+

Please feedback us via e-mail so we can fix and upgrade. It would be helpful.
Thanks for using Kipkam</div>

Exploding Kittens, the most-funded game in Kickstarter history, is now available for iOS.

Creat&#8203;ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).

KEY FEATURES:

- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.

- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers

- All art illustrated by The Oatmeal

- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens

- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history

In this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t&#8203;he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.





Exploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money. You must be at least 13 years old to download and play. There is also an option to compete online against strangers and resulting data transfer charges may apply.  Player usernames and expressions are their own.

<div class="item-text" id="grand-theft-auto-vice-city_TBAPP">Welcome back to Vice City. Welcome back to the 1980s.

From the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Vice City, a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, was one of the most varied, complete and alive digital cities ever created. Combining open-world gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and given the opportunity to take it over as you choose. 

To celebrate its 10 year anniversary, Rockstar Games brings Grand Theft Auto: Vice City to mobile devices with high-resolution graphics, updated controls and a host of new features including: 

‚Ä¢ Beautifully updated graphics, character models and lighting effects 
‚Ä¢ New, precisely tailored firing and targeting options 
‚Ä¢ Custom controls with a fully customizable layout 
‚Ä¢ iCloud save game support 
‚Ä¢ Massive campaign with countless hours of gameplay 
‚Ä¢ Support for Retina display devices 
‚Ä¢ Custom iTunes Playlist* 

*To listen to your custom playlist, simply create a playlist titled ‚ÄúVICECITY‚Äù, launch the game, and select the radio station ‚ÄúTape Deck‚Äù 

Universal App:
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is supported on iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, all iPad models and 4th and 5th generation iPod Touch.

Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!

In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!

What could go wrong?

As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.

As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.</div>

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

While hunting for your lost pet, you suddenly get a call from Papa Louie with some good news:  Your pet was found at Papa's Pancakeria in Maple Mountain, and since your pet likes the restaurant so much, Papa Louie decided to let you run the Pancakeria while he's away!  

You'll be busy multitasking as your customers order fluffy pancakes, golden waffles, warm french toast, and delicious drinks through all seasons of the year.  Pour batter onto the griddle, add mixables to the batter, and keep checking back to flip the flapjacks halfway through.  Stack their plates high with pancakes, syrups, and toppings that change with each holiday.  Add a hot mug of coffee or a refreshing glass of juice to complete the breakfast, and serve the food to your hungry customers.  Customers can also place orders by phone, so hire a driver to deliver a hot breakfast right to their doors!

-- GAME FEATURES --

NEW FEATURES - All of your favorite features from other versions of Papa's restaurants are now available in this "To Go" game, redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens!

HOLIDAY FLAVORS - Celebrate the seasons with new holiday flavors!  As the seasons change in Maple Mountain, your customers will order their pancakes, waffles, and french toast with new seasonal ingredients.  You'll unlock new syrups, toppings, and drinks for each holiday of the year, and your customers will love trying new flavors for a festive breakfast.

SERVE SPECIAL RECIPES - Earn Special Recipes from your customers, and serve them as the Daily Special in the Pancakeria!  Each Special has a bonus you can earn for serving a prime example of that recipe.  Master each special to earn a special prize!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR WORKERS AND PET - Play as Cooper hunting for his lost cat Cookie, or Prudence with her lovable dog Pickle -- or create your own custom character along with your own pet!  You can also show off your holiday spirit with a massive variety of holiday outfits and clothing for your workers.  Choose unique color combinations for each item of clothing, and create your own style with millions of combinations!

SPECIAL DELIVERY - When you start taking phone orders, customers can call to place their breakfast order, and you'll hire a Driver to help you take and deliver orders to their homes!

COLLECT STICKERS - Complete a variety of tasks and achievements while playing to earn colorful Stickers for your collection.  Each customer has a set of three favorite Stickers: Earn all three and you'll be rewarded with a brand-new outfit to give to that customer!

DECORATE THE SHOP - Customize the Pancakeria lobby with themed furniture and decorations for each holiday of the year!  Mix and match your favorite styles, or add items that match the current holiday so customers won't mind waiting longer for their food.

CLIPPING COUPONS - Missing your favorite customer?  Send them a coupon with the help of your friendly mailman, Vincent!  Customers love a good deal, and will promptly arrive to order another meal.  Coupons are great for completing quests for Stickers and for strategically leveling up customers!

Goat Simulator is the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU. You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your mobile dreams have finally come true!

Gameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game. 

DISCLAIMER
Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.

KEY FEATURES
* You can be a goat 
* Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat 
* MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it 
* In-game physics that bug out all the time 
* Seriously look at that goat's neck 
* You can be a goat</div>

ADDING TOPPINGS - The Topping Bin carousel from previous "To Go" games is back, making it easy to browse through your available toppings!  You'll swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the cupcake to start pouring toppings evenly across the cupcake.

In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows. Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.

You have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="papas-pizzeria-to-go_TBAPP">Things get messy when you‚Äôre stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa‚Äôs Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that‚Äôs reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.

You'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!

** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **

Papa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

TOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.

BAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!

CUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!

UPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!

Flick your finger and make a homerun.

‚ñ† Easy Control---------------------------
You only use flick to control the batting for this game. The more accurate you flick your finger to hit the ball; it is more likely that you will be a home-run hitter. 
The rule is simple. Flick your finger with the same feeling in which you would swing a bat in real life. Think of your finger as a bat, and flick it with speed and accuracy. That‚Äôs all.

‚ñ† Movement of the ball------------------
Various kinds of throws are materialized into ‚Äúreal-life like‚Äù feelings. Different pitches pull out different various kinds of movements. Thus, the batter may miss the timing and would be hard to hit.

*Jiant mode ( need F&amp;F 10000 point ) : Match with a Giant pitcher
*Cutter mode ( need Jiant 12000 point ) : Match with cutterballs which can cut the baseball bat.

‚ñ† add 28 Achievement Bonus--------------
1 Achievement = 1 level up bonus!!!

Power: You can increase the power of the bat
Accuracy: You can increase the accuracy of the batting
Batting Eye: You can know ahead of the next ball‚Äôs pattern 

‚ñ† Home-Run Tip!---------------------------
1.Make a full swing with a fast batting-speed!
2.Hit the ball followed from the various thrown pattern with an accurate swing!
3.Let‚Äôs keep an eye on the ball until the end and predict the change of the pattern!
4.Let‚Äôs be confident and make a full swing!

‚ñ† FAQ -------------------------------------
Q : How does STEP UP SYSTEM?
A : STEP UP = More balls
    ex) Minor 1 step = 3 balls
        Minor 2 step = 6 balls</div>

"Skater's innovative, creative controls are a diamond." - 148Apps.com
"Skater‚Äôs controls feel like they‚Äôre built from the ground up for touch, and are gratifyingly elegant." - IGN


All of Skateboarding In The Palm Of Your Hand

Designed by skaters for skaters, we teamed up with 20 of the most prominent brands in skating to create the game every skater has been waiting for:

Powerful And Intuitive Control

Use the touch screen to directly control your shoes and board. Controls have been carefully designed to highlight the things that are most fun and important in actual skating, with a strong focus on flow of tricks and runs.

Every Trick Is Possible

This is the first touch-based skating game to include the full range of street tricks. Jump from Ollie, Switch, Fakie and Nollie and perform all standard flip tricks; with the inclusion of body rotations you can even do tricks such as Front-Side Flips and Big Flips. With recent updates now including Late Flips, Reverts, Ghetto Birds, Impossibles, Dolphin Flips, Dragon Flips and Gazelles. Chain everything together with manuals, nose manuals and every kind of grind and slide.

Share And Discover Runs

Skater allows you to save your favourite trick runs and share them with the world. In turn, you get to discover and copy runs that other players have created ‚Äì giving you access to an endless feed of new ideas to explore.

The Latest Gear ‚Äì Already Included

Pick from the latest shoes and decks to skate with; DC Shoes, Revive, DGK, etnies, Emerica, √©S, Foundation, Lakai, Toy Machine, Zero, Baker, Deathwish, Shake Junt, Amgrip, Spitfire, Thunder, Venture, Pig Wheels, Force and Bro Style ‚Äì they are all already included in the game.

Real, Legendary Spots

The spots featured are El Toro, Carlsbad Gap, Hollywood High, Stoner Plaza, Camp Woodward, Love Park and The Berrics ‚Äì with even more to come in future updates! Starting with architectural plans, height maps and photos we took on-site, every detail of these legendary spots has been faithfully recreated ‚Äì down to the graffiti, street signs and even stickers on obstacles.

Skater Celebrates Style and Individuality

Knowing that different people see different things in a spot and skate it in their own unique way, Skater blurs the line between single and multiplayer experiences to enable social interaction unlike any other previous skating game. It‚Äôs like taking part in a the world‚Äôs biggest online skate session‚Ä¶

Go skate at some of the most famous spots in history with content from thousands of players from around the world ‚Äì any time you want!</div>

Welcome to Ski Safari!

Ski Safari is where Animals, Avalanches and Action come together to create a new casual gameplay experience.

Our deep sleeping hero has to stay ahead of a relentless avalanche that threatens the local mountainsides. Sven, as we like to call him, can use animals to aid his escape from an icey end. Each of the hillside animals have different attributes to make a speedier escape. Penguins glide further, Yetis are tougher, Eagles soar to great heights, each of these can provide useful advantage for Sven. Sometimes on the slopes Sven can find fast Snowmobiles which can ferry multiple animals a maintain a very high top speed.

Staying ahead of the avalanche has its advantages and perks. Completing objectives can 'level up' Sven  and increase his score multiplier. Riding animals, performing backflips add to the score and with an increased score multiplier Sven will rocketing up the highscore table with ease.</div>

- Single Play Mode with 8 fun game options (Time limit optional)
- Arty Party Mode for Rapid-Fire Art Challenges!

In Single Play Mode you can play with or without a time limit and challenge yourself with one of eight fun idea generation and art practice games.

1 - COLOR CHALLENGE:
The Color Challenge game assigns you between 1-5 colors you‚Äôre limited to creating your artwork with. The game generates these colors from the colored materials you add to your Arty Games profile such as paint and color pencils. You can also add Markers by brand (Copic, Mepxy, ProMarker, Prismacolor or 'Other') and build your materials from the official colors and sets for each brand! That way you can Play games like the 3-marker challenge without messing up your collection of markers!

2 - CHARACTER CHALLENGE
The Character Challenge generates random combinations of Character Designs and Scenarios for you to draw. These can turn out funny, or epic ‚Äì and there are billions of combinations to be explored!

3 - ENVIRONMENT CHALLENGE
The Environment Challenge generates a scene for you to draw based in either an Interior or Exterior environment.

4 - INCREMENTAL DESIGN
In the Incremental Design challenge, you draw a character‚Äôs head or body in 5 stages which are revealed one by one, so you won‚Äôt know what the final design will be until the very end ‚Äì surprises lie in store!

5 - SCRIBBLE CHALLENGE
The scribble Challenge generates a random doodle for you to copy down and turn into a work of art.

6 - COPY CHALLENGE
In the Copy challenge, you are given an image to reproduce as closely as possible, which will help your observation and drawing skills, and can be a good warm-up to a drawing session too!

7 - DESIGN MIX
The Design Mix challenge presents you with two random items which you must thematically or aesthetically combine in a creative way.

8 - CUSTOM GENERATOR
The Custom Generator allows you to build your own lists to generate ideas and games from. The possibilities are LITERALLY endless!

If you‚Äôre really up for a challenge, you can start an Arty Party!

ARTY PARTY MODE:
This mode is great to challenge yourself in, or play with a group of friends. Simply select the number of challenges you want to play and the level of intensity ‚Äì (be warned, 'Intense' is named that for a reason!), and after you pick the games you want to be included, hit GO and get ready for a mashup of insane challenges that will test the skill of even the most experienced artists.

You are Da Vinci‚Äôs most promising apprentice. Your master, Leonardo, has disappeared. You have no idea where he‚Äôs gone or what has happened. So you begin your quest, your search for the truth. However, Leonardo's workshop is full of puzzles, inventions, escape mechanisms and objects hidden in all corners of beautifully decorated rooms.

We allow you to warp back into your early days as a young apprentice, exploring the 16th century world around you, peeking into Leonardo‚Äôs mechanisms, puzzles and devices, as you eventually become powerful enough to control time itself and learn the secrets hidden in the past.

Many challenging puzzles are inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci's real inventions and ideas. Mysterious locations were created based on original artworks and the wonderful Florence, Italy of 1506.

STORY

In the distant future, the only sentient beings in the world are robots. 

They are the last remnant of the human spirit. 

However, mankind is not dead. 

Technology exists that is capable of transferring memories to these robots. 

But with limited space, new memories will gradually overwrite the old. 

To prevent the emotions in human memories from fading away, the robots resorted to converting the emotions to music, and storing them in a place called Cytus. 

The robots use these songs to experience human emotion and dream that souls exists in each of them...

<div class="item-subtitle">V. 6.6.0</div>
<div class="item-text" id="pinochle-plus_TBAPP">This is a no-ads version of the first and most popular pinochle app for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle Plus is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. To try before you buy, see our free, ad-supported Pinochle app. If you prefer, our other pinochle app with no advertising, Pinochle Gold, has more card backs and tabletops to choose from, and includes support for more languages.

Pinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.

In this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).

BIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.

MELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).

TRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.

SCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team's total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score. Play continues until one team goes out.</div>

‚ÄúThis is the best game on the Apple Watch‚Äù - Time.com

Lifeline is a playable, branching story of survival against all odds. Using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, you will help Taylor make life or death decisions, and face the consequences together.

Acclaimed writer Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) weaves a gripping interactive story through the aftermath of a crash landing on an alien moon. Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and Taylor‚Äôs communicator can only reach you. 

A totally unique experience enabled by modern devices, this story plays out in real time. As Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you‚Äôre free. You can even respond to Taylor directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.

Or, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and see what happens when you make a different choice. Simple actions can have a profound effect. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.

Lifeline is a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes. Taylor is relying on YOU.

NEW in version 1.8: Stick around after the game for a special story epilogue from Dave Justus. For players who have already finished the game, the Sneak Peek becomes available under the game options. Enjoy!

<div class="item-text" id="sheeping-around_TBAPP">The pastures are green and the day is warm. Shepherd Hazel Woof is grazing her sheep peacefully. What could go wrong on this bright sunny day? Little does she know, her sheep could be ambushed at any moment. Poacher Alex McCunning has been luring her sheep to traps he‚Äôs made. Fortunately for Hazel, Alex gets spotted and she can now take action. Will she be able to defend her sheep or will Alex steal them away? 

The fate of the sheep is up to you to decide. Take control of either of the two characters and prepare for a shepherding duel with your opponent.

---

Sheeping Around is a multiplayer strategy card game about grazing and stealing sheep. The objective is simple: there's three sheep on the board, and you need to take home or steal two of the three sheep to win.

As a shepherd attach graze cards to sheep to graze, and when you're done, use "Whistle" to take them home. As a thief, attach lure cards to sheep to lure them and when they're lured, use "Steal" to steal them away.  But the tricky part is all the other cards that make your opponents' lives harder. You can lay traps, guard sheep, reduce graze / lure values and use special bonus cards to your advantage.

Add deck-building and card collection, and you get the basic elements of a CCG. All in all, an exciting game that will make you ask your friends, ‚ÄúWill you sheep with me?"

Key features:

* Unique, never-seen-before gameplay mechanics in a tragicomic setting.
* Quick 5-10 minute matches: Play on your commute or on the loo! 
* Smart multiplayer match-making with level based progression. 
* Challenge your friends and ask them to "sheep" with you!</div>

<div class="item-text" id="my-pocket-galaxy-3d-sandbox_TBAPP">If you had the power, how would you create the solar system? What would be the size of each planet or star? And how would you place them in orbit? If you are interested in Astronomy and looking for a powerful yet easy to use 3 dimensional space sand box app to create and simulate a whole new galaxy with realistic physics rules, then you‚Äôve come to the right place. Orbit Sandbox Universe, the 3D sand box game, provides you the ultimate power to explore the infinite space and simulate your own space full of different planets, gas giants, and stars. 

In this gravity simulator app, you get to customize literally any aspect of these particles to simulate and design your very own solar system in this sand box. Once you are satisfied with your customized solar system (or any other combination of particles, planets, and stars), you get to easily add it to your collection, take a screenshot and share it with the world.
The game comes with a clean and neat design and the 3D simulation is so smooth that you won‚Äôt feel any difficulties or lags when bombarding your planets, or applying any condition to them. And make sure not to take the realistic gravity lensing effect as granted when looking at a black hole. It‚Äôs just fascinating. 

Is this Orbit Sandbox Easy to Use?
Is this 3D galaxy sand box with realistic physics simulation powerful enough to create and design different planets, gas giants and stars? The answer is a BIG yes! But are the simulation tools easy to use? The answer is even a BIGGER yes! The user interface is so friendly, that you‚Äôll get used to it after going through the step-by-step tutorial and trying available tools for a few times. After that, you just need to use your imagination and be creative to form some unique pocket galaxies with gravity simulator based on physics rules. If you are going to redesign our lovely solar system in our galaxy, you‚Äôll have access to all the planets (mars, moon, earth, mercury etc ‚Ä¶) and you have the power to unlock new worlds by meeting the right conditions, colliding with the right objects, and altering mass and sea level while keeping the temperature stable. To smash stuff together and create new planets, make sure to crash the right ones together. 
Tip: To raise the sea level, hit a planet with ice meteors, and use rock meteors to lower the sea level. 
Orbit Sandbox Main Features at a Glance:
‚Ä¢	Wonderful 3D graphics with smooth space simulation
‚Ä¢	Super user-friendly interface with easy to learn gameplay
‚Ä¢	Step-by-step and detailed tutorial
‚Ä¢	Huge variety of particles, procedural planets, gas giants and stars
‚Ä¢	Ultimate customization options for your creations
‚Ä¢	Gravity simulator with realistic physics rules
‚Ä¢	Create Solar System with the tiniest details 
‚Ä¢	Take screenshots of your universe and share it with family and friends
‚Ä¢	Unlock new achievements
‚Ä¢	Interactive journal to track your creations
‚Ä¢	Save and Load simulated creations
So, Orbit Sandbox Universe offers everything you should expect from such 3D gravity and universe sandbox games and it even sets the bar to a higher level by offering smooth particle simulator, realistic physics rules, user-friendly interface, a wide range of different particles, planets and stars, and a lot more.
No matter you are serious in Astronomy stuff or you just want to have fun creating some beautiful infinite universes, we‚Äôve got you covered. You just need to take your time, select from wide range of stunning particles, stars, and planets, specify their positions and how they should rotate, and last but not the least decide which planets should collide to destroy and create new worlds.

<div class="item-text" id="this-war-of-mine_TBAPP">"If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you." - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK

"This War of Mine isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúfun,‚Äù but it‚Äôs definitely a game worth playing." , 9/10, 148apps

"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad" , Game Informer

In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. 

The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. 

Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.

This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition
It's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same ‚Äì how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? 

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Inspired by real-life events 
‚Ä¢ Control your survivors and manage your shelter 
‚Ä¢ Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves ‚Äì anything that helps you survive 
‚Ä¢ Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience 
‚Ä¢ Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game 
‚Ä¢ Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme

This War of Mine experience is now broadened with "The Little Ones" expansion. "The Little Ones" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective‚Äïthat of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.

‚Ä¢ Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine
‚Ä¢ Protect innocent children
‚Ä¢ Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need
‚Ä¢ Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children

**************************************

The app can be used by kids practicing for a weekly spelling test or spelling bee, or those looking to improve vocabulary ahead of school end of year tests.

From the App Store:

"Love this design!  Simple, easy to use, interactive.  I have downloaded eight different spelling apps - all four stars +.  However, this is the best one I have found for my son." (5 star review)

"We use this app to help my daughter study for her weekly spelling test. It is a great study tool. She gets 100% on almost all of her tests."

"My husband and I enjoyed recording our daughter's weekly spelling words (using silly voices, of course!). My nine year old was giggling as she learned - who knew spelling could be so fun?"

"My daughter practices her spelling list on this every night. It works great, easy to use and set up. She loves earning points to buy squeeberangs. Way more fun than practicing on paper, and helps them find their way around the keyboard too."

<div class="item-text" id="numberblocks-hide-and-seek_TBAPP">From the multi award-winning animators and producers of BAFTA nominated pre-school learning favourites Alphablocks and Numberblocks, we bring you Numberblocks Hide and Seek.

As seen on Cbeebies.

This app helps your child get to grips with addition, number bonds and other key number skills. Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. 

‚óè Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.

‚ñ∫ Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.

‚ñ∫ When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. 

‚ñ∫ Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don‚Äôt know, take a guess.

‚ñ∫ Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      
                  
‚ñ∫ Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               

‚ñ∫ An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         

‚ñ∫ You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!

As you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!

Keep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="note-rush-music-reading-game_TBAPP">Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! 

Play with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.

"Great app for learning notes!" - App Store Review.

"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him." - App Store Review.

"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons." - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me 

"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching." - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com

"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com

"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club." - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com

Listens to Your Instrument
------------------------------
Note Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&amp;A below for more about supported instruments.)

Student-paced
------------------
Note Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!

Grand Staff Context
-----------------------
The whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students learn how notes are spaced out&nbsp;across the two staves.

Octave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography
---------------------------------------------
It's a "B", but which "B"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.

Great for Home Practise
-------------------------
Students will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.

Levels
-------
Note Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!

Better Than Flash Cards!
-------------------------
Use Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!

--
Note Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher.</div>

Become the ultimate Dungeon Master as you bribe, entice and coax your heroes through their adventures on a quest to restore your guild to its ultimate glory! Guild of Dungeoneering is a unique turn-based RPG with a twist: instead of controlling the hero, you build the dungeon around him. Using cards drawn from your Guild decks, you lay down rooms, monsters, traps and of course loot! Meanwhile your hero is making his own decisions on where to go and what to fight. But will he be strong enough to take on the dungeon's overlord? In between dungeon runs and card based battles, manage your Guild building new rooms to attract new classes of adventurer and to expand your decks of cards with more powerful items and events. 

Build up your Guild with new rooms to attract new classes of adventurer and collect powerful items and abilities. From lowly Chumps to renowned Cartomancers, you‚Äôll need all the recruits you can get in this challenging rogue-like RPG where no two dungeons are ever the same. Lead your hero to battle with the dangerous dungeon overlord, where his skill will be put to the ultimate test - for the glory of your Guild!

Our second expansion pack, Ice Cream Headaches, is now available! Quest through the snowy mountains, visit the ice cream monks and battle all new monsters like the Slushie Elemental and the Pygmy Mammoth. With 21 new quests, 30 new monsters and 3 new classes, it‚Äôs our biggest expansion yet!

Ice Cream Headaches also introduces Favour, an all new gameplay mechanic which can aid in your quest‚Äôs success‚Ä¶ or failure.  Earn Favour by defeating monsters in rooms with a Rune of Fate, and spend your Favour to earn powerful card-manipulation effects. Use your Favour to draw extra cards in battle, or even remove weaker cards from your deck for the rest of the quest.

All this plus our first expansion pack, Pirates Cove, is available now!

&gt;Pay attention, at first glance, you just can't see anything in stereogram, needs reading intently, through a special viewing method, it immediately become into a three-dimensional window that you have put into a various kinds of goods, try it,:)

A practical method for watching stereogram:
Take the screen brightness down, place a finger or pen in front of the screen.
Observe its reflection in screen, Search its reflection around.
After a while you should be able to see the three-dimensional image.

Tips: 
1. When you create a stereogram contains large amounts of text, you should try to reduce "Depth Range" and "Image distance"Ôºåthere should not contain too many characters in the frame width of watching, otherwise it will lead to reading difficulties.
2. You should select the texture its content is complex and rich color changes, the random-dot texture generated by software can guarantee good imaging effect. 
3. The height of texture determines the fine of image and the size of stereogram, also determines the creating time. If the texture height more than 1080 pixels, it will be adjusted to 1080 pixels in creating. 
4. A pattern with a transition edge will form a better imaging effect.
5. If the midline position of the imaging is not good, you can try to choose the second Create-Mode.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="hard-time-vip_TBAPP">This special "VIP" edition allows you to enjoy the hit prison sim at its best with no ads and full access to the editor! Create your own inmate and attempt to survive in a prison where every sentence is a "death" sentence. Rub shoulders with up to 100 fellow inmates in a sprawling facility of 12 unique areas, each filled with fully interactive furniture and props. Plus a life beyond the gates populated by real civilians, with wardens enforcing dozens of different laws to keep you as far away from it as possible.

Each day, you will find your health and mental state slipping away. Both can be restored by sleeping - which is also a good way to pass time. You won't always be permitted to sleep, though, so consuming food and drink bridges the gap. These, along with many other activities such as reading or watching TV, can also help to improve your mental state. If you "lose your mind" you will temporarily lose control of your character - and will almost certainly get into trouble!

Your character also has a set of attributes that you are challenged to improve:
- STRENGTH indicates how much damage you can inflict or absorb. You can improve it by fighting or lifting weights.
- AGILITY determines how fast you move. You can improve it by jogging in the yard or scoring baskets.
- INTELLECT reflects your knowledge - including fighting skills such as counters. You can improve it by reading books.
- REPUTATION is how much other prisoners respect you. It can be improved by accomplishing tasks or intimidating others.

There are also opportunities to earn money - whether you work for it with a broom, trade items at a profit, or run with a gang. Having money increases your opportunities to grease the wheels and make your life inside easier.

You may find that you need to go to the toilet from time to time, in which case you must race to the bathroom! Alternatively, you could find a toilet to sit on or grab some toilet paper to spare your blushes. Failing to do so will damage your reputation and mental state.

I regret that there is more to this game than I could ever explain here, so I hope you enjoy figuring some things out for yourself!

==== IMPORTANT ==== 
"Minecraft" is a trademark of Mojang AB. 
Skins can only be uploaded to supported Minecraft platforms (i.e. Java and Bedrock Edition only at this moment in time). However, you can still design and share skins if you don't play these editions. The app does NOT support the creation of custom skins for Xbox edition at this time (it's impossible for us to add because the games don't support them!), although if the game allows it in the future, we will defiantly add definitely for it. 

This version of the app may pop-up to tell you about important announcements from 57Digital Ltd. However, this will only happen in rare cases and will only ever pop-up once.

*** Uploading skins to Minecraft.net or Bedrock Edition requires the Minecraft game.</div>

Praise for Lifeline:
‚ÄúI‚Äôve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.‚Äù - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo

‚ÄúFor a few brief hours I cared ‚Äì really cared ‚Äì about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don‚Äôt think any other game I‚Äôve played has made me feel that way before.‚Äù - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer</div>
