- What your baby can understand &amp; learn after this mental leap‚Ä® 
- What your baby can do after this leap‚Ä® 
- What you can do to help your baby‚Ä® ‚Ä®

This app is also a handy reminder for new parents when their baby‚Äôs brain is changing, or ‚Äúleaping,‚Äù the baby is making a significant advance in mental development, and with each step forward comes a drastic change in the way your baby sees the world around him. Because these leaps come so quickly, the ‚Äúnew world‚Äù and new abilities can sometimes be scary, and the development can initially manifest in poor sleep, bad appetite, crying, clinging and crankiness ‚Äì exhausting and frustrating mom and dad.‚Ä®

International experts on The Wonder Weeks:‚Ä® ‚ÄúThis is a very practical and entertaining window into the baby‚Äôs first year and a half. van de Rijt and Plooij have observed and found the vulnerable times in an infant‚Äôs development that I independently came to in my book Touchpoints (Perseus Books Group). The authors‚Äô observations and practical suggestions are wonderful.‚Äù‚Ä® -T. Berry Brazelton, M.D., professor emeritus, Harvard Medical School‚Ä® ‚Ä®

"Anyone who deals with infants and young children will want to read The Wonder Weeks. This book will open parents' eyes to aspects of their children's growth, development, changing behavior, and emotional responsiveness that they might otherwise not notice or find puzzling and distressing."‚Ä® -Catherine Snow, Ph.D., Shattuck Professor of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education‚Ä® ‚Ä®

About AutoSleep
-----------------
Using Advanced Heuristics AutoSleep works out how long you've slept so you don't have to.

If you DO wear your Watch to bed, you don't need to do a single thing. AutoSleep will track your sleep &amp; quality and send you a notification in the morning.

Even if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.

If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. 

As everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. 

If you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. 
*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. 

AutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart &amp; activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. 

*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher. WatchOS 5 recommended.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="dark-sky-weather_TBAPP">Dark Sky is the most accurate source of hyperlocal weather information. With down-to-the-minute forecasts, you‚Äôll know exactly when the rain will start or stop, right where you‚Äôre standing. (It‚Äôs like magic.) 

Featured in: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Wired, and more.

YOUR WEATHER, DOWN TO THE MINUTE 
Dark Sky is able to create forecasts for your precise location, giving you minute-by-minute predictions for the next hour and hour-by-hour forecasts for the next day and week.

BEAUTIFUL WEATHER ANIMATIONS 
The same technology that powers Dark Sky‚Äôs predictions also allows us to make the world‚Äôs first perfectly smooth radar animation. Other apps show you a chunky slideshow that makes it nearly impossible to tell how storms are moving. But Dark Sky‚Äôs radar animation lets you see the actual path of the storm: how it moved in the past, and where it‚Äôs going in the future. 

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS 
Dark Sky comes with advanced notification options: Receive down-to-the-minute alerts before it starts raining at your exact location, get notified of government severe weather alerts (for such things as thunderstorms, flooding, hurricanes, etc.), or even create your own custom notifications covering the next 24 hours for things like temperature, wind, precipitation and more. Even if you haven‚Äôt opened the app in days, Dark Sky will tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it. 

TODAY WIDGET
The Dark Sky Notification Center Widget tells you at a glance what‚Äôs going to happen in the next hour and the next week, so you don‚Äôt even have to unlock your phone to quickly check the weather before heading out.

TIME MACHINE
Explore weather in the past or future. Choose a date and see historical weather data or future predictions based off of seasonal averages.

Dark Sky looks great on your wrist. Get notifications and check out the weather for the next week with the Dark Sky app built from scratch for Apple Watch.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="superimpose_TBAPP">Just with a few taps, create professional grade superimposed or juxtaposed photos on your iPhone! You don't need a computers and expensive software to superimpose or blend/mix/combine/cut/copy/paste one photo on top of another any more.

Here is how it works...

1. Load a background image.
2. Load a foreground image.
3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.
4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.
5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.
6. Adjust the colors/exposure/contrast/hue/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.
7. You are done! Save the blended image to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.

You can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.

Masking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, polygon, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear, radial gradient, mask from image, mask from text, magic mask and hair refine masking tools. Mask an area with this tool and that area of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.

You can even drop a shadow of the foreground onto the background.</div>

Notes
---

‚Ä¢ Playing over the internet requires your home network to be set up correctly. In most cases R-Play does this for you automatically. Some users may need to perform this set up manually, according to the instructions found in the included help guide.
‚Ä¢ For the best streaming experience, your PS4 should be connected to your home network via LAN cable and your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch should be connected to a 5GHz WiFi network.

‚Ä¢ If you need any assistance, our technical support team are on hand and are committed to quickly resolving any issues that you may encounter.

-----------------------------------------------------
*IMPORTANT* 
HeartWatch 3 requires iOS 10 or iOS 11. Watch OS 3 or Watch OS 4.
If you are missing the Watch App or Experiencing crash on restart, please press the Review tab and click on App Support. This explains what you need to do! Please email us if you are stuck. We love to help. 
-----------------------------------------------------

Your Apple Watch is a highly sophisticated instrument, measuring and capturing your heart rate data throughout the day.

HeartWatch lets you see how your heart is beating across four simple views. Waking, Regular, Workout &amp; Sleeping. Each of these views are isolated because, while you may want a higher heart rate during a workout, if your heart is racing when you aren't doing any exercise then this is likely not a good thing and probably something you might want to show your medical practitioner. 

HeartWatch gives you an easy solution to this. It accesses your heart rate &amp; workout readings created by your Apple Watch and unlocks the power of this information in a simple, intuitive way. 

INTRODUCING HEART BADGES
HeartWatch 2 introduces heart badges. These are a simple glanceable graphic that lets you quickly see how your heart is doing for different types of events. The colours represent time in zones overlayed with an average. 

For regular* heart rate readings, the ideal is to have a completely blue badge. The bigger the red ring around the badge, the more time spent with an elevated heart rate. Even though averages can appear to be similar, the badge shows a clear picture of how your heart has really been tracking and alerts you about excessively high or low readings. 

For workouts, you can easily see the zonal makeup of your workout at a glance.

*regular: time spent not sleeping nor working out.

AN INTELLIGENT COMPLICATION
The complication displays the last heart rate reading captured by your watch. 

A FAST, EASY TO USE WATCH APP
An instant background update has you seeing your latest heart rate and a summary of your day. You can take your "live" pulse at any time by tapping the Pulse gauge. You can start a workout directly in the app and get live updates on your heart rate zone. You can also track sleep and add measurements &amp; notes. 

AMAZING NAVIGATION
Whether you are looking for heart rate irregularities or checking on your workout progress, HeartWatch makes things very easy via a 12 week big picture. Find out exactly what your heart was doing throughout your day. The addition of an energy overlay to the regular heart rate detail view means you can determine if those peaks you sometimes get are more likely due to stress or increased activity. 

CAPTURE HEALTH &amp; SLEEP DATA
Capture key HealthKit measurements just by saying them, take notes about your day and track sleep.

NOTIFICATIONS
You can configure notifications for the following scenarios. 
 - When heart rate exceeds a bpm value. 
 - When heart rate drops below a bpm value. 
 - A daily reminder to check how you've gone today. 

NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR HEALTH
Heart Watch is very useful tool to get alerted about any possible health issues in a concise format that you can show your medical practitioner.

REQUIREMENTS
This app requires an iPhone that has the Health App installed. Heart readings are read from the Health Data Store which is ideally populated by your Apple Watch. You can also import heart rate readings from other sources and devices.</div>

‚ÄúForest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.‚Äù      ‚Äî The New York Times
‚ÄúIn order to establish new, better habits, it‚Äôs helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.‚Äù    ‚Äî Business Insider

If you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what's more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. The sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done. 

Stay focused. Be present! 

STAY FOCUSED:
‚Ä¢ Plant lovely trees and stay focused on what's more important in real life.

NOTICE
‚Ä¢ Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.
‚Ä¢ Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.
‚Ä¢ There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team. Thank you for your support!

Sometimes sad moments happen in hospitals, too. The farewell room in Toca Life: Hospital gives loved ones a chance to say goodbye in a peaceful setting. 

AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN
Toca Life: Hospital lets you tell make-believe stories or real-life stories about checkups, X-rays and all the everyday things that happen in a hospital. 

EXPLORE UNITS ON FIVE FLOORS
In the basement, sound the siren on the ambulance in the garage or crack the code on a mysterious machine to open the doors to a secret lab! On the entrance floor, check in at the reception desk and have a seat in the waiting area, or grab a snack from the cafe. The treatment floor has tools to diagnose patients, a lab to check specimens and an operating room. The family care floor has a unit just for kids and a maternity unit with an ultrasound machine, nursery cribs and newborn babies! Patients on the general care floor can visit a peaceful garden to reflect on life. And when a loved one dies, say your final goodbyes in the farewell room.

FEATURES
- Explore five floors: basement, main entrance, lab and treatment, family care and general care.
- Move characters from floor to floor in the big elevator.

<div class="item-subtitle">V. 3.8.2</div>
<div class="item-text" id="things-3_TBAPP">*** APPLE DESIGN AWARD WINNER 2017 ***

Meet the all-new Things! A complete rethinking of the original, award-winning task manager ‚Äì with a perfect balance between simplicity and power, incredible new features, delightful interactions, and a timeless new design.


HERE'S HOW THINGS WORKS

If you're new to Things, this is the basic workflow:

1. Collect Your Thoughts
Get things off your mind quickly with Things‚Äô action extension ‚Äì it lets you create to-dos from other apps. Or just talk to Siri on any device (‚ÄúRemind me to...‚Äù) and import from Reminders.

2. Get Organized
Create a project for each of your goals, then add the steps to reach them. For clarity, add structure with headings. Then group your projects by areas of responsibility, such as ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù, ‚ÄúWork‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHealth‚Äù. Review these regularly to stay on top of things.

3. Plan Your Time
See your calendar events alongside your to-dos and plan your time effectively. Create repeating to-dos for things you do every few days, weeks, or months ‚Äì Things will remind you on the right day.

4. Make the Most of Your Day
Every morning, grab a coffee and prepare your list for ‚ÄúToday‚Äù: review previously planned to-dos and make quick decisions on what to tackle. Pick some more steps from your projects and then get going. The Today list is the only place you‚Äôll need to look for the rest of the day.

5. Customize Your Workflow
Use tags to categorize your to-dos or add context. For example, tag places like ‚ÄúOffice‚Äù or ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, or tag all your ‚ÄúErrands‚Äù, or everything you‚Äôre working on with ‚ÄúKate‚Äù. You can easily find everything you‚Äôve tagged via filtering or search.


HERE'S WHY WE THINK YOU'LL LOVE THINGS

1. It stays out of your way.
As you start using Things, you‚Äôll quickly notice how seamlessly all the features fit together to give you an uncluttered, focused experience. There are no unnecessary frills. No pointless gimmicks or useless controls. In fact, you‚Äôll hardly notice the app ‚Äì it‚Äôs just you and your to-dos.

2. Everything revolves around your to-dos.
In Things, each of your to-dos are special. In a list, they simply show a checkbox and the title of your to-do. But when you open them, they extend into a beautiful white piece of paper that‚Äôs ready to hold your thoughts. Additional details (checklists, tags, reminders, deadline) are nicely tucked away in the corner until you need them.

3. It‚Äôs got a touch of magic.
Things removes friction in magical ways. Take the new Magic Plus Button that lets you insert to-dos at any place in a list ‚Äì simply via drag and drop. Or the ease at which you can multi-select and operate on many to-dos at once. Or the natural language date parser: just type ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù, ‚Äúin 4 days", or ‚Äúnext Wednesday", and it will jump to all the right conclusions.

4. It‚Äôs got all the power of iOS.
Things is fully integrated with all the latest iOS technologies: Apple Watch, Calendars, Siri &amp; Reminders, Today Widget, Quick Actions, Action Extension, Handoff, and Notifications.

5. And much more...
Everyone's got their favorite feature, it's impossible to list them all. See what our users love about Things ‚Äì visit our website at: thingsapp.com


WHAT‚ÄôS NEW?

This is a truly incredible update, with dozens of powerful new features. See the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New‚Äù section below for a full list.


THINGS FOR ALL YOUR DEVICES

Get Things for Mac and iPad to enjoy the full power of Things across your devices (sold separately). The apps all stay updated via Things Cloud ‚Äì the push sync service that we custom-built for Things.


QUESTIONS?

If you have any questions, or run into any trouble ‚Äì please contact us. We provide world-class, professional support for Things, and we‚Äôll be glad to help you.</div>

Penny Finder crowdsources information from our users and catalogs items into a database...AKA we put them in a nice searchable table!  You can:

-  Scan a barcode and the app will tell you if an item is a penny based on other user's discoveries (This app is not a Price Scanner, it's a Penny Scanner)

WHAT WE ASSUME YOU KNOW BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD:
We assume that you know what penny items are.
We assume you know what store this app is for.
We assume that you know that UPC codes are very important and critical to finding the correct penny items.  (you shouldn't penny shop based off only images).

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE STORES YOU VISIT WILL HAVE PENNY ITEMS.

THIS APP IS NOT A PRICE SCANNER, it's a Penny Scanner.

***The Penny Scanner's performance is based on the frame rate of your camera on your device.  (Which means older devices such as an iPhone 4S and older model iPods/iPads will scan slower using the Penny Scanner than new devices that have considerably better cameras.)

<div class="item-text" id="white-noise_TBAPP">Do you have trouble going to sleep?  Are you traveling on a plane and need a quick power nap?  Does your newborn baby wake up in the middle of the night?  There are numerous benefits to using White Noise:

‚Ä¢ Helps you sleep by blocking distractions
‚Ä¢ Relaxes and reduces stress
‚Ä¢ Pacifies fussy and crying babies
‚Ä¢ Increases focus while enhancing privacy
‚Ä¢ Soothes headaches and migraines

How many times have you tried to capture artful images with your iPhone camera but were left wishing you had more features to work with? Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.
 
Slow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:
 
MOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.

LIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!

LOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!

Highlights:

‚Ä¢  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO
‚Ä¢  Option to resume capture 
‚Ä¢  Real time live preview - See the result in real time
‚Ä¢  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‚ÄòBlur Strength‚Äô controls
‚Ä¢  Tap to adjust focus/exposure
‚Ä¢  Time-lapse Intervalometer
‚Ä¢  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer 
‚Ä¢  Full resolution support on every devices

With Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go. Download it now and put an end to mere snapshots!

‚ÄîRunners World, June 2012

"It's ridiculously easy to use (it's hard not to, as you just do what you're told) and it's fantastic that you have an encouraging voice talking you through things."
‚ÄîEngadget, June 2012

"Active.com‚Äôs Couch to 5K is one of my favorite‚Ä¶ apps. With its customizable features, interactivity, and well-rounded interface, I may actually stay off the couch this time."
‚Äî148Apps, October 2011

"I knew as soon as I decided to start the Couch to 5K program that I would need something to keep me accountable‚Äînot just to showing up for my training, but to actually doing it properly. Of course there‚Äôs an app for that."
‚ÄîCalorieLab, April 2012

"If you have been struggling to get your buns off the couch and somewhat in shape before the summer hits, training for a 5K is not a bad way to start. If you are looking for a program to help get you there, then the ‚ÄúCouch to 5K‚Äù running plan by CoolRunning is probably your best bet if you haven‚Äôt done an ounce of athletic activity for a number of years."

<div class="item-subtitle">V. 2.0.44</div>
<div class="item-text" id="ankimobile-flashcards_TBAPP">AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.

AnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:

- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.
- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.
- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.
- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.
- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.
- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.
- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.
- Support for displaying mathematical equations that were added with LaTeX in the desktop software, and ruby text above Asian languages.

Please note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.

Please also note that while you can use almost any language on your cards, AnkiMobile's user interface is only available in English at the moment.

Aside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.

Like all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see http://www.apple.com/itunes/education/

For more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: http://ankisrs.net/docs/AnkiMobile.html

If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="monash-university-fodmap-diet_TBAPP">Researchers at Monash University have developed&nbsp;the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of&nbsp;gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable&nbsp;bowel&nbsp;syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75%&nbsp;of people with IBS experience&nbsp;symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.

The app comes directly from the research team at Monash&nbsp;and includes the following:

- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.
- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.
- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a&nbsp;simple 'traffic light system'. 
- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.
- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.
- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods
- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten,&nbsp;IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.
- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="northern-lights-photo-taker_TBAPP">This app only does one thing and that's to help you take better photos of the aurora borealis, aka the northern lights.

Here's the scenario - so you see the northern lights (!! - awesome for you, by the way), but you don't have a fancy digital camera with you.  Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  

OK!  Now what??

Do you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do! Enable manual mode; set the focus to infinity; change the temperature to a certain number; change the ISO between certain values; change the shutter speed to something else....wait what...?

Don't worry, this app does all of that for you so all you have to do is find those lights.  ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!

Welcome to Toca Lab: Elements! Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. 

Discover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! 

* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.
* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. 
* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! 
* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.
* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.

Each element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? 

The time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!

Toca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it‚Äôs a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science. Toca Lab: Elements is just a starting point for further exploration!

<div class="item-text" id="promote-army-study-guide_TBAPP">BEFORE YOU BUY ANOTHER BOARD STUDY APP ASK YOURSELF:

1. Does it offer over 3,400 questions?  Our app contains thousands more than some other apps.  You don't have to study all 3,400+ questions but they are there for you if you want.  
2. CAN YOU GRADE YOURSELF?  Seriously!  Many board apps don't even allow you to grade yourself.  You can't look at your test scores for each subject because they don't even keep score.
3. Does it have an advanced learn engine that tracks questions seen/unseen, answered correctly/incorrectly, and then dynamically creates your tests accordingly?
4. Does it provide BOTH a casual study mode AND a test mode?
5. Does it provide AUDIO questions?
6. Are you able to SEE your study and test PROGRESS for ALL lessons at a MERE GLANCE?
8. Can you customize your tests with adjustable question counts and subjects?
9. Does it allow you to add your own unit study documents and files to the app?  Most units have unique study requirements such as unit history.  This app allows you to easily add those documents directly into the app.

This is a comprehensive guide addressing the common Army promotion board topics - over 40 subjects. Information was taken directly from Army regulations, Army doctrine reference publications (ADRPs), Army doctrine publications (ADPs), field manuals, technical manuals, training circulars, and pamphlets. All the study material is in question/ answer/ flashcard format. Hyperlinks are used in the larger sections to help better facilitate the blocks of information. In addition, to help support some of the question/answers, notes are provided throughout along with Helpful Hints to aid in memory recall.

[ History ]

Rain measurements were reported in ancient literature in India A.C. 400, Palestine 200 A.C. in China around 1247.
The first standardized rain gauge was built in Korea in 1441 by Prince Munjong, son of King Sejong the Great.
In 1639 Benedetto Castelli, a student of Galileo, it made measurements of rainfall using a cylindrical container made of glass, where it measured the water level after the rain. In 1662 Christopher Wren invented the rocking rain gauge, the prototype of the modern rain gauges, which was perfected in 1670 by Robert Hooke.
Up to about 10-20 years ago it was indicated as rain gauges those instruments that in fact they had no way to record the time evolution of the rain and which were controlled to a daily basis.
Unlike the pluviograph was a tool that could, by means of a mechanical registration system, to graphically report the amount of rain fall in a certain time interval
With the development  of electronics and then computer science , the pluviographs have gone increasingly asserting itself.

The graphics are perfected to the last detail to make using simple, fluid and pleasant.
Optimized for Retina Display on the iPhone and iPad.

<div class="item-text" id="watchchat-for-whatsapp_TBAPP">WatchChat is the first app that allows you to send and receive WhatsApp messages on your Apple Watch. You only need to scan a QR code and then you are ready to roll!

With WatchChat, you can
- access all of your WhatsApp chats (and group chats)
- reply to chats via keyboard, quick replies, dictation and scribble
- use a variety of different keyboard layouts*
- view pictures (and zoom into them in native resolution)
- listen to voice messages
- customize quick replies and chat font size
- start a new chat right from the Watch
- archive chats 
- ‚Ä¶

*The currently supported keyboard layouts are: 
- ABC (English, Deutsch, Espa√±ol, Portugu√™s, ◊ê◊ë◊í◊ì◊î, ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨, Suomi)
- QWERTY (English)
- QWERTY (Espa√±ol)
- QWERTZ (Deutsch)
- ◊ê◊ë◊í◊ì◊î)◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™)
- QWERTY (Italiano) 
- AZERTY (Fran√ßais)

Setting up the app for the first time only takes 4 simple steps:
- open the app on your Apple Watch
- open WhatsApp
- in WhatsApp, go to "Settings" &gt; "WhatsApp Web/Desktop" &gt; "Scan QR Code"
- scan the QR code that will appear on your Apple Watch after 10-30 seconds
- if a popup comes up, just try again, it will work out eventually :)

As this is a 3rd-party-app, I would really appreciate if you had suggestions for further development so I can take your ideas into consideration. If you encounter issues while using the app, don't hesitate to contact me, I am more than happy to help. 

Please keep in mind that, as the app isn‚Äôt officially affiliated with WhatsApp, available features and functionality are subject to change. To keep up with everything, the app has been updated about once per week since its release in 2017 - I am always looking for ways to offer new features or improve the existing ones.</div>

<div class="item-subtitle">V. 1.1.2</div>
<div class="item-text" id="papas-freezeria-to-go_TBAPP">Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!

You've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!

You'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.

Keep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!

** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**

Papa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

BUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.

MIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!

TOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from "Papa's Burgeria To Go!" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!

**GAME FEATURES**

- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe
- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens
- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping
- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips
- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders
- Challenging Closers and Food Critic
- 120 in-game achievements to earn

**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**

Papa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out "Papa's Freezeria HD" for iPad!</div>

‚Ä¢ I'm a nutrition coach and I tell all of my clients to get this app if they need food ideas. It is a fantastic resource to expand your pallet and to make fat loss taste good. Combine the workouts and recipe sections and you've essentially got yourself a coach. Great app. In my opinion it is under priced for the value that you get!

‚Ä¢ This app is absolutely perfect for anyone!! From either a total beginner just wanting to get started right through to someone looking to get in serious shape. I upgraded from Gymster lite as soon as it was released. As a bikini competitor Gymster recipes give me all I need for a productive off season and a lot of variety and colour to my meals. The macros are all broken down which saves me a huge amount of time. I also use this app to track my workouts and have them pre loaded in. The random selection tool is also great for those days when you just aren't feeling it!! Can't recommend enough

‚Ä¢ I'm finishing my year of personal training at my gym and this is the best app for someone like me to learn and keep track of my workouts. Thanks to Bert Kreischer for the heads up on his podcast.


‚Ä¢ I've used a few gym apps in the past, but this is undoubtedly the best! The reason for that is the 'random' selection for workouts-input body part(s) and the amount of exercises, and away you go! Gives me a fresh workout every time!</div>

Gameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat.

When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game. 

DISCLAIMER
Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.

KEY FEATURES
* You can be a goat 
* Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat 
* MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it

Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.

From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?

"For all the simplicity of the game‚Äôs controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‚Äòs is frightening. It‚Äôs a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It‚Äôs elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games." -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com

<div class="item-text" id="donut-county_TBAPP">Donut County is a story-based physics puzzle game where you play as an ever-growing hole in the ground. Meet cute characters, steal their trash, and throw them in a hole.

WHERE TRASH IS TREASURE
Raccoons have taken over Donut County with remote-controlled trash-stealing holes. You play as BK, a hole-driving raccoon who swallows up his friends and their homes to earn idiotic prizes. 

When BK falls into one of his own holes, he‚Äôs confronted by his best friend Mira and the residents of Donut County, who are all stuck 999 feet underground‚Ä¶ and they demand answers!

THE HOLE KEEPS GROWING
‚Ä¢ EXPLORE every character‚Äôs home, each with their own unique environment.
‚Ä¢ MOVE the hole to swallow up their stuff, growing bigger each time.
‚Ä¢ COMBINE objects inside for crazy effects: cook soup, breed bunnies, launch fireworks, and more.
‚Ä¢ CATAPULT things back out of the hole. You can use it to solve puzzles...or just destroy stuff.
‚Ä¢ DEVOUR everything. The hole won‚Äôt stop until the whole county is all gone.
 
Donut County was created by Ben Esposito, designer on What Remains of Edith Finch and The Unfinished Swan. It is the result of six years of solo development, dozens of donuts (for research), and one fateful encounter with a raccoon.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="exploding-kittens_TBAPP">New ways to play! Play with friends or strangers in online play, or play offline with friends face-to-face!

Exploding Kittens, the most-funded game in Kickstarter history, is now available for iOS.

Creat&#8203;ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).

KEY FEATURES:

- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.

- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers

- All art illustrated by The Oatmeal

- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens

- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history

In this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t&#8203;he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.





Exploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money. You must be at least 13 years old to download and play. There is also an option to compete online against strangers and resulting data transfer charges may apply.  Player usernames and expressions are their own.

Unlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.

Vehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.

the depths of their souls. 

One day, √Üsir, who had never shown his face before, suddenly announced that he will be holding the first mega virtual concert ‚Äî‚Äî √Üsir-FEST and will invite a top idol singer and a popular DJ as opening performances. The instant the ticket sales began, an unprecedented rush occurred. Everyone wanted to see √Üsir's real face. 

On the day of the FEST,  millions of people were connected to the event. At one hour before the event started,  the previous world record for most simultaneous connection was smashed. The whole city was on its feet, waiting for √Üsir to descent from the skies...

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

While hunting for your lost pet, you suddenly get a call from Papa Louie with some good news:  Your pet was found at Papa's Pancakeria in Maple Mountain, and since your pet likes the restaurant so much, Papa Louie decided to let you run the Pancakeria while he's away!  

You'll be busy multitasking as your customers order fluffy pancakes, golden waffles, warm french toast, and delicious drinks through all seasons of the year.  Pour batter onto the griddle, add mixables to the batter, and keep checking back to flip the flapjacks halfway through.  Stack their plates high with pancakes, syrups, and toppings that change with each holiday.  Add a hot mug of coffee or a refreshing glass of juice to complete the breakfast, and serve the food to your hungry customers.  Customers can also place orders by phone, so hire a driver to deliver a hot breakfast right to their doors!

-- GAME FEATURES --

NEW FEATURES - All of your favorite features from other versions of Papa's restaurants are now available in this "To Go" game, redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens!

You'll unlock new syrups, toppings, and drinks for each holiday of the year, and your customers will love trying new flavors for a festive breakfast.

SERVE SPECIAL RECIPES - Earn Special Recipes from your customers, and serve them as the Daily Special in the Pancakeria!  Each Special has a bonus you can earn for serving a prime example of that recipe.  Master each special to earn a special prize!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR WORKERS AND PET - Play as Cooper hunting for his lost cat Cookie, or Prudence with her lovable dog Pickle -- or create your own custom character along with your own pet!  You can also show off your holiday spirit with a massive variety of holiday outfits and clothing for your workers.  Choose unique color combinations for each item of clothing, and create your own style with millions of combinations!

SPECIAL DELIVERY - When you start taking phone orders, customers can call to place their breakfast order, and you'll hire a Driver to help you take and deliver orders to their homes!

Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!

In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!

What could go wrong?

As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.

As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.</div>

<div class="item-text" id="papas-burgeria-to-go_TBAPP">Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  

You're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!

Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!

**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**

Papa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!

Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

GRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!

BUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!

<div class="item-text" id="papas-pizzeria-to-go_TBAPP">Things get messy when you‚Äôre stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa‚Äôs Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that‚Äôs reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.

You'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!

** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **

Papa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

TOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.

BAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!

CUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!

UPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!

Flick your finger and make a homerun.

This is a game in which you can experience various throws based on the pendulum. The ball will fly further if you can hit the ball directly with the quick flick. Experience a ‚Äúreal-life like‚Äù batting simulation. 


‚ñ† Easy Control---------------------------
You only use flick to control the batting for this game. The more accurate you flick your finger to hit the ball; it is more likely that you will be a home-run hitter. 
The rule is simple. Flick your finger with the same feeling in which you would swing a bat in real life. Think of your finger as a bat, and flick it with speed and accuracy. That‚Äôs all.

‚ñ† Movement of the ball------------------
Various kinds of throws are materialized into ‚Äúreal-life like‚Äù feelings. Different pitches pull out different various kinds of movements. Thus, the batter may miss the timing and would be hard to hit.

‚ñ† 10 GAME mode------------------------
You can enjoy this game through 5 kinds of mode.
Minor &amp; Major Mode- Hit as many home-runs as you can; as far as you can.
Multiplayer Mode- You can compete with other players via Game Center.

*Faster &amp; faster ( need total 25000 point ) : Head-to-head with only fastballs.
*Jiant mode ( need F&amp;F 10000 point ) : Match with a Giant pitcher
*Cutter mode ( need Jiant 12000 point ) : Match with cutterballs which can cut the baseball bat.

‚ñ† add 28 Achievement Bonus--------------
1 Achievement = 1 level up bonus!!!
 
‚ñ† Level Up System-----------------------
You can choose and upgrade 1 of 3 skills every time the exp becomes full.-
Power: You can increase the power of the bat
Accuracy: You can increase the accuracy of the batting
Batting Eye: You can know ahead of the next ball‚Äôs pattern 

‚ñ† Home-Run Tip!---------------------------
1.Make a full swing with a fast batting-speed!
2.Hit the ball followed from the various thrown pattern with an accurate swing!
3.Let‚Äôs keep an eye on the ball until the end and predict the change of the pattern!
4.Let‚Äôs be confident and make a full swing!

‚ñ† FAQ -------------------------------------
Q : How does STEP UP SYSTEM?
A : STEP UP = More balls
    ex) Minor 1 step = 3 balls
        Minor 2 step = 6 balls</div>

<div class="item-text" id="60-seconds-atomic-adventure_TBAPP">60 Seconds! is a dark comedy atomic adventure of scavenge and survival. Collect supplies and rescue your family before the nuke hits. Stay alive in your fallout shelter. Make difficult decisions, ration food and hunt mutant cockroaches. And maybe survive. Or not.

60 Seconds! requires at least an iPhone 5, iPad 3, or iPad mini 2.

As Ted, a responsible citizen and a family man, you are faced with a slight disturbance to your happy, suburban lifestyle. THE NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE.

With only 60 seconds left to impact, guide Ted in a mad, intense and action packed dash through his house in search of his family and useful supplies. Everything will be against you - time, your very own furniture, the house that's different every time you play and the fundamental question - what to take with you and who to leave behind?

Reaching the fallout shelter in time and alive is only the beginning. Whatever you scavenged and whoever you saved will play a vital role in your survival. Each survival story will be different, with every day surprising you with unexpected events. Will all of these stories end well? It's up to you. Ration food and water, make best use of your supplies, face difficult choices and even venture into the wasteland.

Good luck.

SURVIVE
in a fallout shelter with whatever you brought with you. How many days will you last? Will everyone make it out alive?

Welcome to Ski Safari!

Ski Safari is where Animals, Avalanches and Action come together to create a new casual gameplay experience.

Our deep sleeping hero has to stay ahead of a relentless avalanche that threatens the local mountainsides. Sven, as we like to call him, can use animals to aid his escape from an icey end. Each of the hillside animals have different attributes to make a speedier escape. Penguins glide further, Yetis are tougher, Eagles soar to great heights, each of these can provide useful advantage for Sven. Sometimes on the slopes Sven can find fast Snowmobiles which can ferry multiple animals a maintain a very high top speed.

Staying ahead of the avalanche has its advantages and perks. Completing objectives can 'level up' Sven  and increase his score multiplier. Riding animals, performing backflips add to the score and with an increased score multiplier Sven will rocketing up the highscore table with ease.</div>

All of Skateboarding In The Palm Of Your Hand

Designed by skaters for skaters, we teamed up with 20 of the most prominent brands in skating to create the game every skater has been waiting for:

Powerful And Intuitive Control

Use the touch screen to directly control your shoes and board. Controls have been carefully designed to highlight the things that are most fun and important in actual skating, with a strong focus on flow of tricks and runs.

Every Trick Is Possible

This is the first touch-based skating game to include the full range of street tricks. Jump from Ollie, Switch, Fakie and Nollie and perform all standard flip tricks; with the inclusion of body rotations you can even do tricks such as Front-Side Flips and Big Flips. With recent updates now including Late Flips, Reverts, Ghetto Birds, Impossibles, Dolphin Flips, Dragon Flips and Gazelles. Chain everything together with manuals, nose manuals and every kind of grind and slide.

Share And Discover Runs

Skater allows you to save your favourite trick runs and share them with the world. In turn, you get to discover and copy runs that other players have created ‚Äì giving you access to an endless feed of new ideas to explore.

The Latest Gear ‚Äì Already Included

Starting with architectural plans, height maps and photos we took on-site, every detail of these legendary spots has been faithfully recreated ‚Äì down to the graffiti, street signs and even stickers on obstacles.

Skater Celebrates Style and Individuality

Knowing that different people see different things in a spot and skate it in their own unique way, Skater blurs the line between single and multiplayer experiences to enable social interaction unlike any other previous skating game. It‚Äôs like taking part in a the world‚Äôs biggest online skate session‚Ä¶

Winner of the Excellence in Design award at Freeplay 2018.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a puzzle fan, I can‚Äôt stress it enough ‚Äî you need to play this game.‚Äù ‚Äî AppUnwrapper

‚ÄúDissembler is one of those puzzle games that just feels good to play around with, but it backs that simple joy with a solid spate of puzzles and gameplay modes.‚Äù ‚Äî Shaun Musgrave, Touch Arcade

About the game: 

Flip pairs of tiles to make matching color groups vanish, but that's where the resemblance to a standard match-three ends. In Dissembler no tiles will drop in to replace the ones you‚Äôve matched: your task is to remove all tiles and leave behind a clean slate. The experience starts simply, leading you gently from basic principles to more complex puzzles, but before long it will require careful planning and lateral thinking.

‚ñ† Beautifully-presented minimalist puzzle game with chilled original soundtrack

‚ñ† Every one of the 171 puzzles is a hand-made work of art with no randomness

‚ñ† Experiment freely ‚Äì undo any number of moves at any time without any penalty

‚ñ† Buy once and enjoy forever ‚Äì no in-app purchases!

‚ñ† Free daily puzzles, plus step-by-step solutions revealed the next day

‚ñ† Infinite mode offers an endless play mode with Game Center leaderboard

The game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:
Various computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...

The popular Catan expansions "Seafarers", "Cities and Knights" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.

The complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!

The Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan ‚Äì but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan‚Äôs new wealth! You‚Äôll need your best knights to fend them off! C&amp;K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.

Exciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios "Enchanted Land" and "The Great Canal". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.

Features:

- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese

***** 
Catan FAQ: 

Question: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? 
Answer: Don‚Äôt worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. 

Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? 
Answer: When saved games can‚Äôt be automatically restored, we‚Äôve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter ‚ÄûCatanWarp*‚Äú (* = 1‚Äì15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1‚Äì15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. 

Question: Are dice rolls really random? 
Answer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We‚Äôre avid Catan players ourselves. We‚Äôve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game!

<div class="item-text" id="reigns_TBAPP">Sit on the throne as a benevolent (or malevolent) medieval monarch of the modern age and swipe your royal fingers either left or right to impose your will upon the kingdom. Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family‚Äôs dynasty at risk!

Each year of your reign brings another important ‚Äì seemingly random ‚Äì request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.

FINAL FANTASY VI for the iPhone/iPod touch/iPad is here!

FINAL FANTASY VI first debuted in 1994 as the sixth installment in the iconic FINAL FANTASY series. Innovations included the ability to play all the main characters as the game's protagonist, and to this day, its epic story intertwining each of their fates is still highly rated and wildly popular. The characters' dramatic performances are also highly rated, including the catastrophe occurring midway through, which delivers a particular emotional jolt to players.

With plenty of abilities available and the magicite system for controlling spells/summoning, players can develop their characters any way they want. This was also the first FINAL FANTASY game to include the Ultima Weapon, the most powerful sword of all and a recurring item in subsequent titles within the series.


Features

‚Ä¢ Game data saved with iCloud can now be shared across devices! At home or away, on your iPhone or iPad, pick the play style that's best for you.

‚Ä¢ All graphics have been painstakingly recreated, bringing the world of FINAL FANTASY VI to your mobile device for the very first time! Kazuko Shibuya, one of the graphics designers involved in the FINAL FANTASY series from the very start, personally worked on the main characters and supervised the recreation of the game's graphics.

‚Ä¢ Square Enix's vast experience in A-list smartphone RPG titles has been harnessed in implementing intuitive user-friendly controls that make the game easy to play on touch screens. The battle interface has received particular attention, with a complete overhaul for use on your smartphone.

‚Ä¢ This smartphone release includes the new magicites and events that were introduced in the 2006 remake.

‚Ä¢ Some events have been optimized to be played with user-friendly touch controls.


Story
The War of Magi left little but ashes and misery in its wake. Even magic itself had vanished from the world. Now, a thousand years later, humankind has remade the world through the power of iron, gunpowder, steam engines, and other machines and technologies.

But there is one who possesses the lost power of magic--a young girl name Terra whom the evil Empire has kept enslaved in an effort to harness her power as weapon. This leads to a fateful meeting between Terra and a young man named Locke. Their harrowing escape from the Empire's clutches sets in motion a series of events that touches countless lives and leads to one inevitable conclusion.

<div class="item-text" id="iron-marines_TBAPP">From the creators of the award winner Kingdom Rush trilogy comes the most extraordinary space odyssey. A real-time, dynamic and deep strategy game that will transport you to amazing and unknown planets. Immersive, engaging gameplay, ridiculously appealing art, and a touch of silly humor. Brave soldiers, mighty mechas and powerful aliens await your command to face the greatest challenges.

Recruit and train the greatest heroes in the galaxy, lead them into dangerous missions against near impossible odds and unleash their mighty powers and abilities. Adapt your strategy by changing the role of your troops even in the thick of the combat, from ranger to sniper, from flamethrowers to missile launchers. Turn the tide of battle with bomb strikes, intelligent mines, support troops, turrets and a wide range of special weapons.

Armies of robots, crushed starships, gigantic monsters, unknown races, brave assaults, desperate rescues, audacious sabotages... the galaxy needs your command.
