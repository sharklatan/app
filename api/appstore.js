Start anywhere with anyone, and either take shots in the ring as a wrestler or call the shots backstage as a booker - promoting entertaining matches every week for ratings. Seeing each side of the curtain gives you an even better appreciation for the other, and ensures you'll never grow bored of wrestling again!\r\n\r\nYour purchase also includes a \"Backstage Pass\" that allows you to save your changes to all 9 rosters before pitting them against each other in dream matches of your own creation! With 4 pages of rules to mix & match - including up to 20 wrestlers in rings of any shape or size - the only limit is your imagination. You can also blow off steam with no pressure by revisiting the 8 weeks of shows from the game's promotional tour. Not to mention the interactive training process that teaches you how to lock up in the first place.\r\n\r\nBASIC CONTROLS\r\nThe game features an interactive tutorial that you are advised to play through, but the basic controls are as follows:\r\nCURSORS = Movement (double-tap to dash)\r\nA = Attack (with a direction to aim high, without to aim low)\r\nG = Grapple\r\nR = Run\r\nP = Pick-Up \/ Drop (with a direction to throw)\r\nT = Taunt \/ Pin \/ Referee duties\r\nEYE = Change focus \/ Turn opponent around\r\nHEALTH METER = Switch character\r\nCLOCK = Pause \/ Change camera angle\r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE\r\nAlthough every effort has been made to keep performance as high as possible, some devices may benefit from a visit to the Options menu to fine tune the display:\r\n- The number of characters is perhaps the biggest factor so consider turning off referees and setting a limit on the match size.\r\n- If you don't want to sacrifice numbers, you can sacrifice polygons instead and opt for \"Basic\" character models (no fingers).\r\n- The ropes are surprisingly demanding and you may squeeze in an extra character if you make them \"Static\".\r\n- Turning off shadows and reducing crowd sprites may also help.",

The original idea is to make a 3D version \"Flappy Bird\" with a different perspective, but in the production process, I suddenly found that the game has a quiet loneliness: A plane flies slowly alone in the dark channel by passing one after another obstacle, but seems never reach the end of channel, which is slight shiny in the distance. In the influence of some literary and artistic works, I have been very interested in loneliness, and there are rarely games which express mainly the lonely sense in the market, so that the game topic is decided as this. \r\nAs a programmer who begins to learn art, I understand that to create roles and environment with rich details in short time is unrealistic, so I decide to pay a tribute to the art style of the \"2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d, and this style features \"Loner\" that the entire scene tones can be arbitrarily transformed.\r\n\r\nBGM List\r\n1.Deepsea\r\n2.Sea Sand \r\n3.Time \r\n4.Tunnel\r\n5.Voices \r\n6.Void",

A game where you don't master a single task but rather explore a range of concepts. As a result, the levels are sometimes mysterious, and other times very direct. Sometimes completely still, and other times moving at the speed of light.

The aim is to help the body function correctly in about thirty steps or so throughout the entire day. Each scene breaks down daily acts, such as opening your eyes, chewing a toast or listening to music, through seamless navigation and intuitive and inventive gameplay.\r\n\r\nFritz Kahn, a pioneer of infographics and popular science, came up with easy to understand analogies to enable people to improve their understanding of the human body. By combining old school design with a contemporary influence, Homo Machina delights with its clever dialogue between the absent-minded director at the helm of the body-machine and Josiane, his diligent secretary, encouraging players to put to task the armada of workers to get the incredible factory up and running. \r\n\r\nAfter Californium, Homo Machina is the new video game created by Darjeeling production.

Could you remember the story?\r\n\r\nINNOVATIVE PUZZLES THAT ARE THE STORY\r\n\r\nEach level sparks a little memory of the person\u2019s life. It\u2019s a two-part puzzle: a visual image of the memory and a telescopic text, that reveals itself with every step. You start with fragmented pieces of the picture attached to dashed lines. Dragging them like strings, you move parts of the image to restore it. In turn telescopic text reacts to your every step \u2013 the closer you are to the solution, the more text unfolds. And if you're not moving in the right direction, the story piece too can drift away from the truth. You are indeed remembering \u2013 adding details to the memory and forming a clear picture.\r\n\r\nRELAXING AND ATMOSPHERIC\r\n\r\nThe game has a delightful relaxing flow with atmospheric music and haptic feedback - all this helps you to dive into this compelling story even more. No scores, no timers, no \"game over\".\r\n\r\nA DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS STORY\r\n\r\nG30 is about memory and consciousness \u2013 and what they mean for a human being. There are people around who are losing their ability to remember \u2013 some kinds of mental diseases do that to a person. G30 shows how they see the world, how they feel about the past they can\u2019t remember and the reality they can\u2019t recognize.\r\n\r\nAWARDS\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMost Innovative Game\u201d award at both Casual Connect USA and Casual Connect Kyiv, \u201cBest Mobile Game\u201d and \u201cCritics' Choice\u201d at GTP Indie Cup, \u201cGDC Special Award\u201d and \u201cAmazon Special Award\u201d at Get IT Conference.",

		"TBAppDescription": "This is an adaptation for iOS of the original desktop game by Jason Rohrer. If you have played the original, you will recognize Jason's cute and quirky graphics and sounds, as well as the wonderful premise: rebuilding civilization from scratch, together with other players and across countless generations.\r\n\r\nYou are born either as a baby to one of the other players, or as a young woman if no suitable mother is found. Every minute of real time is one year in the game and your maximum age is 60 years. A single life is limited, but the things you make during your lifetime are left for your children and grandchildren once you are gone. Try to make life a little bit easier for those who come after you, so your family line will have a chance to prosper for generations to come.\r\n\r\nSometimes you will spawn alone in the wilderness. You need to build a fire to stay warm and trap rabbits to get meat and furs for clothes. A sharp stone may be your best friend in the beginning. Try to find a good spot to settle and grow some food, because other players may soon arrive as your children, and will need to be taken care of until they are grown enough to help you.\r\n\r\nSometimes you will be born in a sprawling city, with farmers, cooks, blacksmiths, shepherds and hunters. There will be clothes and equipment ready for you, prepared by players who may be your grandparents or distant relatives. Maybe you will gather some friends and set out to start a settlement of your own, maybe you will inherit a farm job from your uncle, or maybe you will slay bears and wolves. The choices are endless, but remember: unless you leave the world better after you have lived than when you arrived, you have not really achieved anything.\r\n\r\nEvery life you play will put you in contact with new players. Some are more experienced than you, some are less. Some will teach you and some will learn from you. Some may even be disruptive to the civilization you are building, and will need to be dealt with accordingly. It will be up to you and your fellow players to shape the world for a brief moment in time, before the following generations take over.\r\n\r\nAfter your game life is over, you can look at your family tree and see how your descendants are doing. You can take pride in each of your younger relatives who survives into adulthood and in each new generation that follows you, knowing that you helped make it happen.",

FOTONICA is a first-person game about the thrill of speed and traveling flawlessly through complex environments. \r\n\r\nOne-handed controls: hold your finger down to run, release to jump, hold in mid-air to dive and land.\r\n\r\nFOTONICA is simple, but is not easy: it follows a tradition of arcade games that are easy to pick up and almost impossible to master. A multi-layered level design across eight different tracks, together with a procedural endless mode make for a game that is incredibly deep. Think you can outrun your friends? Try the split-screen versus challenges. \r\n\r\nThe visuals are a treat for the nostalgic player but also for those hungry for new aesthetics. Every pixel is drawn to convey the maximum sense of speed, an exhilarating journey through light and void.\r\n\r\n- 8 Levels to explore and master.\r\n- Plus 3 different endless levels to compete for high-scores.\r\n- Two-player split-screen multiplayer mode on the same device!\r\n- 18 Achievements to unlock plus game stats. \r\n- Online rankings.\r\n- Beautiful, smooth, and unique vector-style graphics.\r\n- Electronic music by Michael Manning, Nicol\u00f2 Sala, and legendary composer Baiyon.\r\n- 2 Difficulty settings to let you play an even faster version of FOTONICA.\r\n- Play in landscape or portrait mode.\r\n- No ads, no in-app purchases.\r\n- Record and share replays of your best runs.\r\n",

You can only move the top card of a cascading stack or a card in a free cell. A card can be moved to an empty free cell; to the top of another cascading stack with top card of different colour and one higher value; or to one of 4 suit stacks in ascending order from Ace to King. For example, 3 of clubs can be moved to a cascading stack with top card 4 of hearts. Any value card can be moved to an empty free cell or empty cascading stack.\r\n\r\nMOVING CARDS: Tapping a card once will move it to a suit stack if a spot is available or to a pile with available higher card of different color. Double-tapping a card will move it to an open free cell. Alternatively, you can simply drag a card to where you want it to go. If an attempted move is not allowed, the card will shake.\r\n\r\nNOTES: You can reject a new hand that looks too difficult by clicking New Game again. If you click New Game before moving any cards, the game will not count as a loss. Click Undo to undo one move at a time, or Start Over to undo all moves in the current game.",

The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage. \r\n\r\nChoose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you\u2019ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg\u2019s crime bosses.

Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg?\r\n\r\n- Your mission is clear: make $500,000 in 180 days before Jack Boyd reaches retirement. How? That\u2019s up to you!\r\n\r\n- Decisions, decisions! This Is the Police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. Whatever you decide, your choices will influence the game \u2013 and the fate of Jack Boyd.\r\n\r\n- The Good, the Bad, and... the Ugly? The Chief of Freeburg's Police Department deals with all kind of people. It is up to you to find the bad guys and decide how to deal with them.\r\n\r\n- Carry out your duties. As head of Freeburg PD, Jack deals with all sorts of challenges every day: responding to emergencies, managing his officers, defending the department against City Hall and a corrupt mayor, and much more.\r\n\r\n- Solve Investigations and gather evidence against the criminal gangs of Freeburg.\r\n\r\n- Deal with the competing powers of the city. Everyone offers you favors, and each one comes at a price.\r\nRich and fully voiced story: Jack Boyd is portrayed by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem.",

Sorry. You have to beat them all. Don't say I didn't warn you.\r\n- Something for you to discover and something for you to reach.\r\n- Minimalistic graphics emphasizing the goal of the game.\r\n- No menus, options or other unnecessary features for maximum focus.\r\n- Simple swipe controls with slow swipe to preview the next move.\r\n- iCloud support with Game Save synchronization.\r\n- Game Center support with Achievements and Highest Level Leaderboard.\r\n- Haptic Feedback support.\r\n- Always ready to play with no loading screens.\r\n- Super light for those concerned about storage.\r\n- No Ads or In App Purchases! Pay once and play.\r\n- Designed and implemented by one independent developer who loves games and hopes to deliver more of them in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- WHO AM I?\r\n\r\nGames were always my escape from the sad reality. But playing games wasn\u2019t enough for me and I wanted something more. I wanted to make games.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I started my career as a software developer in 2007 and after 2 years of saving I bought my MacBook Pro and iPhone 3GS with a plan to make games in my free time. In 2010 I moved from Poland to Canada to start a new life with my wife, but my dream about making games hasn\u2019t changed. Now, many iPhones later, after many projects and hours spent, my first game that I developed on the same old MacBook, is finally out.\r\n\r\nMy initial goal was to make something simple and quick. That wasn\u2019t me. It took me over a year but it became my most personal game with a meaning behind every single detail. Now when I see other people playing the game and their reactions when solving the puzzles they struggled with, I know it was worth it.\r\n\r\nWho knows, maybe my game will inspire someone somewhere out there to became a developer as well. That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth doing!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- PRIVACY POLICY\r\n\r\nfollow.trail do not collect, store or share any of your data. It never has and it never will. Period.\r\n",

You don't need a computers and expensive software to superimpose or blend\/mix\/combine\/cut\/copy\/paste one photo on top of another any more.\n\nHere is how it works...\n\n1. Load a background image.\n2. Load a foreground image.\n3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.\n4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.\n5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.\n6. Adjust the colors\/exposure\/contrast\/hue\/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.\n7. You are done! Save the blended image to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYou can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.\n\nMasking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, polygon, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear, radial gradient, mask from image, mask from text, magic mask and hair refine masking tools. Mask an area with this tool and that area of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.\n\nYou can even drop a shadow of the foreground onto the background.",

		"TBAppDescription": "*** APPLE DESIGN AWARD WINNER 2017 ***\n\nMeet the all-new Things! A complete rethinking of the original, award-winning task manager \u2013 with a perfect balance between simplicity and power, incredible new features, delightful interactions, and a timeless new design.\n\n\nHERE'S HOW THINGS WORKS\n\nIf you're new to Things, this is the basic workflow:\n\n1. Collect Your Thoughts\nGet things off your mind quickly with Things\u2019 action extension \u2013 it lets you create to-dos from other apps. Or just talk to Siri on any device (\u201cRemind me to...\u201d) and import from Reminders.\n\n2. Get Organized\nCreate a project for each of your goals, then add the steps to reach them. For clarity, add structure with headings. Then group your projects by areas of responsibility, such as \u201cFamily\u201d, \u201cWork\u201d, or \u201cHealth\u201d. Review these regularly to stay on top of things.\n\n3. Plan Your Time\nSee your calendar events alongside your to-dos and plan your time effectively. Create repeating to-dos for things you do every few days, weeks, or months \u2013 Things will remind you on the right day.\n\n4. Make the Most of Your Day\nEvery morning, grab a coffee and prepare your list for \u201cToday\u201d: review previously planned to-dos and make quick decisions on what to tackle. Pick some more steps from your projects and then get going. The Today list is the only place you\u2019ll need to look for the rest of the day.\n\n5. Customize Your Workflow\nUse tags to categorize your to-dos or add context. For example, tag places like \u201cOffice\u201d or \u201cHome\u201d, or tag all your \u201cErrands\u201d, or everything you\u2019re working on with \u201cKate\u201d. You can easily find everything you\u2019ve tagged via filtering or search.\n\n\nHERE'S WHY WE THINK YOU'LL LOVE THINGS\n\n1. It stays out of your way.\nAs you start using Things, you\u2019ll quickly notice how seamlessly all the features fit together to give you an uncluttered, focused experience. There are no unnecessary frills. No pointless gimmicks or useless controls. In fact, you\u2019ll hardly notice the app \u2013 it\u2019s just you and your to-dos.\n\n2. Everything revolves around your to-dos.\nIn Things, each of your to-dos are special. In a list, they simply show a checkbox and the title of your to-do. But when you open them, they extend into a beautiful white piece of paper that\u2019s ready to hold your thoughts. Additional details (checklists, tags, reminders, deadline) are nicely tucked away in the corner until you need them.\n\n3. It\u2019s got a touch of magic.\nThings removes friction in magical ways. Take the new Magic Plus Button that lets you insert to-dos at any place in a list \u2013 simply via drag and drop. Or the ease at which you can multi-select and operate on many to-dos at once. Or the natural language date parser: just type \u201ctomorrow\u201d, \u201cin 4 days\", or \u201cnext Wednesday\", and it will jump to all the right conclusions.\n\n4. It\u2019s got all the power of iOS.\nThings is fully integrated with all the latest iOS technologies: Apple Watch, Calendars, Siri & Reminders, Today Widget, Quick Actions, Action Extension, Handoff, and Notifications.\n\n5. And much more...\nEveryone's got their favorite feature, it's impossible to list them all. See what our users love about Things \u2013 visit our website at: thingsapp.com\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEW?\n\nThis is a truly incredible update, with dozens of powerful new features. See the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d section below for a full list.\n\n\nTHINGS FOR ALL YOUR DEVICES\n\nGet Things for Mac and iPad to enjoy the full power of Things across your devices (sold separately). The apps all stay updated via Things Cloud \u2013 the push sync service that we custom-built for Things.\n\n\nQUESTIONS?\n\nIf you have any questions, or run into any trouble \u2013 please contact us. We provide world-class, professional support for Things, and we\u2019ll be glad to help you.",

		"TBAppDescription": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations that were added with LaTeX in the desktop software, and ruby text above Asian languages.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nPlease also note that while you can use almost any language on your cards, AnkiMobile's user interface is only available in English at the moment.\n\nAside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see http:\/\/www.apple.com\/itunes\/education\/\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: http:\/\/ankisrs.net\/docs\/AnkiMobile.html\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

	"TBAppDescription": "\"HeartWatch is so good, you\u2019d think Apple built the app itself.\" John Patrick Pullen, Time Magazine. Top 5 in Health & Fitness in 63 countries. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n*IMPORTANT* \nHeartWatch 3 requires iOS 10 or iOS 11. Watch OS 3 or Watch OS 4.\nIf you are missing the Watch App or Experiencing crash on restart, please press the Review tab and click on App Support. This explains what you need to do! Please email us if you are stuck. We love to help. \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nYour Apple Watch is a highly sophisticated instrument, measuring and capturing your heart rate data throughout the day.\n\nHeartWatch lets you see how your heart is beating across four simple views. Waking, Regular, Workout & Sleeping. Each of these views are isolated because, while you may want a higher heart rate during a workout, if your heart is racing when you aren't doing any exercise then this is likely not a good thing and probably something you might want to show your medical practitioner. \n\nHeartWatch gives you an easy solution to this. It accesses your heart rate & workout readings created by your Apple Watch and unlocks the power of this information in a simple, intuitive way. \n\nINTRODUCING HEART BADGES\nHeartWatch 2 introduces heart badges. These are a simple glanceable graphic that lets you quickly see how your heart is doing for different types of events. The colours represent time in zones overlayed with an average. \n\nFor regular* heart rate readings, the ideal is to have a completely blue badge. The bigger the red ring around the badge, the more time spent with an elevated heart rate. Even though averages can appear to be similar, the badge shows a clear picture of how your heart has really been tracking and alerts you about excessively high or low readings. \n\nFor workouts, you can easily see the zonal makeup of your workout at a glance.\n\n*regular: time spent not sleeping nor working out.\n\nAN INTELLIGENT COMPLICATION\nThe complication displays the last heart rate reading captured by your watch. \n\nA FAST, EASY TO USE WATCH APP\nAn instant background update has you seeing your latest heart rate and a summary of your day. You can take your \"live\" pulse at any time by tapping the Pulse gauge. You can start a workout directly in the app and get live updates on your heart rate zone. You can also track sleep and add measurements & notes. \n\nAMAZING NAVIGATION\nWhether you are looking for heart rate irregularities or checking on your workout progress, HeartWatch makes things very easy via a 12 week big picture. Find out exactly what your heart was doing throughout your day. The addition of an energy overlay to the regular heart rate detail view means you can determine if those peaks you sometimes get are more likely due to stress or increased activity. \n\nCAPTURE HEALTH & SLEEP DATA\nCapture key HealthKit measurements just by saying them, take notes about your day and track sleep.\n\nNOTIFICATIONS\nYou can configure notifications for the following scenarios. \n - When heart rate exceeds a bpm value. \n - When heart rate drops below a bpm value. \n - A daily reminder to check how you've gone today. \n\nNOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR HEALTH\nHeart Watch is very useful tool to get alerted about any possible health issues in a concise format that you can show your medical practitioner.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nThis app requires an iPhone that has the Health App installed. Heart readings are read from the Health Data Store which is ideally populated by your Apple Watch. You can also import heart rate readings from other sources and devices.",

		"TBAppDescription": "KetoDiet App the original low-carb app from KetoDietApp.com\n\nKetoDiet is not just about losing weight at any cost; it's about adopting a healthier lifestyle. Apart from reducing your carbohydrate intake, you will learn why it\u2019s important to follow a whole foods based approach and include healthy fat sources like olive oil, fatty fish and pastured meat in your everyday diet. \n\nA healthy low-carb diet is an effective weight loss tool as it will keep your blood sugar level stable and your appetite under control. Apart from fat burning effects, a low-carbohydrate lifestyle can additionally improve health conditions including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and inflammation, all of which increase the risk of developing heart disease. \n\nThe ketogenic diet appears to be useful adjuvant to treatment for health conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type 2 Diabetes, epilepsy and even some types of cancer.\n\nHOW IS KETODIET BETTER THAN OTHER APPS?\n\n1. No subscription fee. You only pay once and everything is included.\n\n2. Free content added daily including recipes, articles, expert advice and more.\n\n3. Accuracy is crucial for a low-carb diet.

All nutritional data in KetoDiet are based on accurate, verifiable sources, rather than user-generated contributions or other unreliable sources.\n\n4. We keep your data private - KetoDiet is not a free app in exchange for your data.\n\nMORE THAN JUST AN APP...\n\nKetoDietApp.com is one the top low-carb websites. More than two million people visit us every month. \n\n- Thousands have already joined our KetoDiet Challenges to stay motivated while following a healthy low carb diet.\n- Facebook support group to help you get started and answer any questions you may have.\n\nWHAT IS KETO?\n\nWhen you follow a ketogenic diet by reducing your carb intake to less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body will start producing ketones in the liver. You will enter ketosis and start using fat and ketone bodies as energy source. One of the main benefits of ketosis is its ability to suppress appetite. While your ketone levels will increase, your blood glucose levels and insulin levels will drop, leading to satiety. You will naturally eat less and the number of calories eaten will drop.\n\nKETODIET APP HIGHLIGHTS\n\nKETO RECIPES: \nKetoDiet includes 300 low-carb, paleo & primal recipes plus over 650 FREE recipes from our integrated keto blog.\n\n- Detailed and accurate nutritional facts\n- Optional ingredients offer more flexibility\n- Serving size adjustment\n- Favorite recipes to quickly find them\n\nPROFILE:\n- Set you carbohydrate limit and goals\n- Built-in Keto calculator to determine your ideal macronutrient intake\n- Update your weight, body fat & measurements to track your progress\n- Sign up for a free KetoDiet account to sync across multiple devices\n\nPLANNER\/TRACKER: \nPlan your keto meals with our intuitive diet planner.

You don't have to study all 3,400+ questions but they are there for you if you want.  \n2. CAN YOU GRADE YOURSELF?  Seriously!  Many board apps don't even allow you to grade yourself.  You can't look at your test scores for each subject because they don't even keep score.\n3. Does it have an advanced learn engine that tracks questions seen\/unseen, answered correctly\/incorrectly, and then dynamically creates your tests accordingly?\n4. Does it provide BOTH a casual study mode AND a test mode?\n5. Does it provide AUDIO questions?\n6. Are you able to SEE your study and test PROGRESS for ALL lessons at a MERE GLANCE?\n8. Can you customize your tests with adjustable question counts and subjects?\n9. Does it allow you to add your own unit study documents and files to the app?  Most units have unique study requirements such as unit history.  This app allows you to easily add those documents directly into the app.\n\nThis is a comprehensive guide addressing the common Army promotion board topics - over 40 subjects. Information was taken directly from Army regulations, Army doctrine reference publications (ADRPs), Army doctrine publications (ADPs), field manuals, technical manuals, training circulars, and pamphlets. All the study material is in question\/ answer\/ flashcard format. Hyperlinks are used in the larger sections to help better facilitate the blocks of information. In addition, to help support some of the question\/answers, notes are provided throughout along with Helpful Hints to aid in memory recall. \n\nForceReadiness.com is not affiliated with the US Army.

Great app. In my opinion it is under priced for the value that you get!\n\n\u2022 This app is absolutely perfect for anyone!! From either a total beginner just wanting to get started right through to someone looking to get in serious shape. I upgraded from Gymster lite as soon as it was released. As a bikini competitor Gymster recipes give me all I need for a productive off season and a lot of variety and colour to my meals. The macros are all broken down which saves me a huge amount of time. I also use this app to track my workouts and have them pre loaded in. The random selection tool is also great for those days when you just aren't feeling it!! Can't recommend enough\n\n\u2022 I'm finishing my year of personal training at my gym and this is the best app for someone like me to learn and keep track of my workouts. Thanks to Bert Kreischer for the heads up on his podcast.\n\n\n\u2022 I've used a few gym apps in the past, but this is undoubtedly the best! The reason for that is the 'random' selection for workouts-input body part(s) and the amount of exercises, and away you go! Gives me a fresh workout every time!",

Whether it\u2019s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful\u2014it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you\u2019ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.",

Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that\u2019s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.",

		"TBAppDescription": "This is a no-ads version of the first and most popular pinochle app for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Play single- or double-deck with configurable options including meld bids and shoot the moon. Pinochle Plus is updated frequently with user-suggested features and AI improvements. To try before you buy, see our free, ad-supported Pinochle app. If you prefer, our other pinochle app with no advertising, Pinochle Gold, has more card backs and tabletops to choose from, and includes support for more languages.\n\nPinochle is a card game played with a 48- or 80-card deck of 9s, 10s, jacks, queens, kings and aces. The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and optionally to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.\n\nIn this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).\n\nBIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer's left is required to bid, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 35 points (for 48 cards) or 60 (for 80 cards). High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and optionally exchanges cards with her partner.\n\nMELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 15 points. Aces in all four suits is 10 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 4 points, or 30 points for double pinochle (two of each).\n\nTRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, 4 cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 1 point per ace, ten or king.\n\nSCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team's total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score. Play continues until one team goes out.",

		"TBAppDescription": "The pastures are green and the day is warm. Shepherd Hazel Woof is grazing her sheep peacefully. What could go wrong on this bright sunny day? Little does she know, her sheep could be ambushed at any moment. Poacher Alex McCunning has been luring her sheep to traps he\u2019s made. Fortunately for Hazel, Alex gets spotted and she can now take action. Will she be able to defend her sheep or will Alex steal them away? \n\nThe fate of the sheep is up to you to decide. Take control of either of the two characters and prepare for a shepherding duel with your opponent.\n\n---\n\nSheeping Around is a multiplayer strategy card game about grazing and stealing sheep. The objective is simple: there's three sheep on the board, and you need to take home or steal two of the three sheep to win.\n\nAs a shepherd attach graze cards to sheep to graze, and when you're done, use \"Whistle\" to take them home. As a thief, attach lure cards to sheep to lure them and when they're lured, use \"Steal\" to steal them away.  But the tricky part is all the other cards that make your opponents' lives harder. You can lay traps, guard sheep, reduce graze \/ lure values and use special bonus cards to your advantage.\n\nAdd deck-building and card collection, and you get the basic elements of a CCG. All in all, an exciting game that will make you ask your friends, \u201cWill you sheep with me?\"\n\n---\n\nKey features:\n\n* Unique, never-seen-before gameplay mechanics in a tragicomic setting.\n* Quick 5-10 minute matches: Play on your commute or on the loo! \n* Smart multiplayer match-making with level based progression. \n* Challenge your friends and ask them to \"sheep\" with you!",

	"TBAppDescription": "If you had the power, how would you create the solar system? What would be the size of each planet or star? And how would you place them in orbit? If you are interested in Astronomy and looking for a powerful yet easy to use 3 dimensional space sand box app to create and simulate a whole new galaxy with realistic physics rules, then you\u2019ve come to the right place. Orbit Sandbox Universe, the 3D sand box game, provides you the ultimate power to explore the infinite space and simulate your own space full of different planets, gas giants, and stars. \n\nIn this gravity simulator app, you get to customize literally any aspect of these particles to simulate and design your very own solar system in this sand box. Once you are satisfied with your customized solar system (or any other combination of particles, planets, and stars), you get to easily add it to your collection, take a screenshot and share it with the world.\nThe game comes with a clean and neat design and the 3D simulation is so smooth that you won\u2019t feel any difficulties or lags when bombarding your planets, or applying any condition to them. And make sure not to take the realistic gravity lensing effect as granted when looking at a black hole. It\u2019s just fascinating. \n\nIs this Orbit Sandbox Easy to Use?\nIs this 3D galaxy sand box with realistic physics simulation powerful enough to create and design different planets, gas giants and stars? The answer is a BIG yes! But are the simulation tools easy to use? The answer is even a BIGGER yes! The user interface is so friendly, that you\u2019ll get used to it after going through the step-by-step tutorial and trying available tools for a few times. After that, you just need to use your imagination and be creative to form some unique pocket galaxies with gravity simulator based on physics rules. If you are going to redesign our lovely solar system in our galaxy, you\u2019ll have access to all the planets (mars, moon, earth, mercury etc \u2026) and you have the power to unlock new worlds by meeting the right conditions, colliding with the right objects, and altering mass and sea level while keeping the temperature stable. To smash stuff together and create new planets, make sure to crash the right ones together. \nTip: To raise the sea level, hit a planet with ice meteors, and use rock meteors to lower the sea level. \nOrbit Sandbox Main Features at a Glance:\n\u2022\tWonderful 3D graphics with smooth space simulation\n\u2022\tSuper user-friendly interface with easy to learn gameplay\n\u2022\tStep-by-step and detailed tutorial\n\u2022\tHuge variety of particles, procedural planets, gas giants and stars\n\u2022\tUltimate customization options for your creations\n\u2022\tGravity simulator with realistic physics rules\n\u2022\tCreate Solar System with the tiniest details \n\u2022\tTake screenshots of your universe and share it with family and friends\n\u2022\tUnlock new achievements\n\u2022\tInteractive journal to track your creations\n\u2022\tSave and Load simulated creations\nSo, Orbit Sandbox Universe offers everything you should expect from such 3D gravity and universe sandbox games and it even sets the bar to a higher level by offering smooth particle simulator, realistic physics rules, user-friendly interface, a wide range of different particles, planets and stars, and a lot more.\nNo matter you are serious in Astronomy stuff or you just want to have fun creating some beautiful infinite universes, we\u2019ve got you covered. You just need to take your time, select from wide range of stunning particles, stars, and planets, specify their positions and how they should rotate, and last but not the least decide which planets should collide to destroy and create new worlds. \nDownload and let us know about any bugs, feature requests or any other suggestions.\n\nThe app formerly known as Pocket Universe.",

		"TBAppDescription": "\"If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you.\" - , 9\/10, Pocket Gamer UK\n\n\"This War of Mine isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfun,\u201d but it\u2019s definitely a game worth playing.\" , 9\/10, 148apps\n\n\"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad\" , Game Informer\n\nIn This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\nThis War of Mine: Anniversary Edition\nIt's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same \u2013 how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? \n\nKey Features:\n\u2022 Inspired by real-life events \n\u2022 Control your survivors and manage your shelter \n\u2022 Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves \u2013 anything that helps you survive \n\u2022 Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience \n\u2022 Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game \n\u2022 Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\n\nThis War of Mine experience is now broadened with \"The Little Ones\" expansion. \"The Little Ones\" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective\u2015that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n\n\u2022 Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine\n\u2022 Protect innocent children\n\u2022 Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need\n\u2022 Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is optimized for latest devices. While playing on older devices such as iPhone 4s or iPad 2 you might experience lower frame rates.",

However, this is the best one I have found for my son.\" (5 star review)\n\n\"We use this app to help my daughter study for her weekly spelling test. It is a great study tool. She gets 100% on almost all of her tests.\"\n\n\"My husband and I enjoyed recording our daughter's weekly spelling words (using silly voices, of course!). My nine year old was giggling as she learned - who knew spelling could be so fun?\"\n\n\"My daughter practices her spelling list on this every night. It works great, easy to use and set up. She loves earning points to buy squeeberangs. Way more fun than practicing on paper, and helps them find their way around the keyboard too.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for features, please e-mail info@keystagefun.co.uk",

Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n\u25ba When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n\u25ba Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don\u2019t know, take a guess.\n\n\u25ba Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n\u25ba Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n\u25ba An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n\u25ba You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make.",

		"TBAppDescription": "Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! \n\nPlay with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him.\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com\/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students learn how notes are spaced out\u00a0across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you!

		"TBAppDescription": "This special \"VIP\" edition allows you to enjoy the hit prison sim at its best with no ads and full access to the editor! Create your own inmate and attempt to survive in a prison where every sentence is a \"death\" sentence. Rub shoulders with up to 100 fellow inmates in a sprawling facility of 12 unique areas, each filled with fully interactive furniture and props. Plus a life beyond the gates populated by real civilians, with wardens enforcing dozens of different laws to keep you as far away from it as possible.\n\nEach day, you will find your health and mental state slipping away. Both can be restored by sleeping - which is also a good way to pass time. You won't always be permitted to sleep, though, so consuming food and drink bridges the gap. These, along with many other activities such as reading or watching TV, can also help to improve your mental state. If you \"lose your mind\" you will temporarily lose control of your character - and will almost certainly get into trouble!\n\nYour character also has a set of attributes that you are challenged to improve:\n- STRENGTH indicates how much damage you can inflict or absorb. You can improve it by fighting or lifting weights.\n- AGILITY determines how fast you move. You can improve it by jogging in the yard or scoring baskets.\n- INTELLECT reflects your knowledge - including fighting skills such as counters. You can improve it by reading books.\n- REPUTATION is how much other prisoners respect you. It can be improved by accomplishing tasks or intimidating others.\n\nThere are also opportunities to earn money - whether you work for it with a broom, trade items at a profit, or run with a gang. Having money increases your opportunities to grease the wheels and make your life inside easier.\n\nYou may find that you need to go to the toilet from time to time, in which case you must race to the bathroom! Alternatively, you could find a toilet to sit on or grab some toilet paper to spare your blushes. Failing to do so will damage your reputation and mental state.\n\nI regret that there is more to this game than I could ever explain here, so I hope you enjoy figuring some things out for yourself!\n\nBASIC CONTROLS:\n(*Look out for tutorials within the actual game)\nA = Attack (on its own to kick, with a direction to punch)\nG = Grapple \/ Throw weapon\nR = Run\nP = Pick-Up \/ Drop\nT = Taunt (interact with handheld props)\n\nOTHER CONTROLS\n- Press ATTACK and RUN together to launch a powerful attack.\n- Press any button with any direction (or none) in a grapple to trigger different moves.\n- Press RUN and PICK-UP together to set fire to a small object (which can then be used to set fire to a large object).\n- Touch the clock to pause the game and bring up options to exit.\n- Touch any speech bubble to speed through conversations.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n- If you find your device struggles to display lots of characters, considering keeping the \"Population\" option low.\n- \"Speed Up Frame Rate\" sleeping will require good performance at the default frame rate.\n- Head to the \"Display\" options to tone down other features.",
