As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither.

We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n\u2022 There is only one version of Forest on the App Store.

Just sleep!\n\nAbout AutoSleep\n-----------------\nUsing Advanced Heuristics AutoSleep works out how long you've slept so you don't have to.\n\nIf you DO wear your Watch to bed, you don't need to do a single thing. AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning once you unlock your iPhone. \n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.\n\nIf you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply put your Watch on charge just before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nA handy Today Widget lets you see how your own \"batteries\" are charged for last night and the previous seven days. A second (entirely optional) widget lets you also track the time you have taken to fall asleep.\n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 3.2 or higher. WatchOS 4.2 recommended.",

			"TBAppDescription": "Just with a few taps, create professional grade superimposed or juxtaposed photos on your iPhone! You don't need a computers and expensive software to superimpose or blend\/mix\/combine\/cut\/copy\/paste one photo on top of another any more.\n\nHere is how it works...\n\n1. Load a background image.\n2. Load a foreground image.\n3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.\n4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.\n5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.\n6. Adjust the colors\/exposure\/contrast\/hue\/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.\n7. You are done! Save the blended image to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYou can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.\n\nMasking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, polygon, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear, radial gradient, mask from image, mask from text, magic mask and hair refine masking tools. Mask an area with this tool and that area of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.\n\nYou can even drop a shadow of the foreground onto the background.",

			"TBAppDescription": "\"HeartWatch is so good, you\u2019d think Apple built the app itself.\" John Patrick Pullen, Time Magazine. Top 5 in Health & Fitness in 63 countries. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n*IMPORTANT* \nHeartWatch 3 requires iOS 10 or iOS 11. Watch OS 3 or Watch OS 4.\nIf you are missing the Watch App or Experiencing crash on restart, please press the Review tab and click on App Support. This explains what you need to do! Please email us if you are stuck. We love to help. \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nYour Apple Watch is a highly sophisticated instrument, measuring and capturing your heart rate data throughout the day.\n\nHeartWatch lets you see how your heart is beating across four simple views. Waking, Regular, Workout & Sleeping. Each of these views are isolated because, while you may want a higher heart rate during a workout, if your heart is racing when you aren't doing any exercise then this is likely not a good thing and probably something you might want to show your medical practitioner. \n\nHeartWatch gives you an easy solution to this. It accesses your heart rate & workout readings created by your Apple Watch and unlocks the power of this information in a simple, intuitive way. \n\nINTRODUCING HEART BADGES\nHeartWatch 2 introduces heart badges. These are a simple glanceable graphic that lets you quickly see how your heart is doing for different types of events. The colours represent time in zones overlayed with an average. \n\nFor regular* heart rate readings, the ideal is to have a completely blue badge. The bigger the red ring around the badge, the more time spent with an elevated heart rate. Even though averages can appear to be similar, the badge shows a clear picture of how your heart has really been tracking and alerts you about excessively high or low readings. \n\nFor workouts, you can easily see the zonal makeup of your workout at a glance.\n\n*regular: time spent not sleeping nor working out.\n\nAN INTELLIGENT COMPLICATION\nThe complication displays the last heart rate reading captured by your watch. \n\nA FAST, EASY TO USE WATCH APP\nAn instant background update has you seeing your latest heart rate and a summary of your day. You can take your \"live\" pulse at any time by tapping the Pulse gauge. You can start a workout directly in the app and get live updates on your heart rate zone. You can also track sleep and add measurements & notes. \n\nAMAZING NAVIGATION\nWhether you are looking for heart rate irregularities or checking on your workout progress, HeartWatch makes things very easy via a 12 week big picture. Find out exactly what your heart was doing throughout your day. The addition of an energy overlay to the regular heart rate detail view means you can determine if those peaks you sometimes get are more likely due to stress or increased activity. \n\nCAPTURE HEALTH & SLEEP DATA\nCapture key HealthKit measurements just by saying them, take notes about your day and track sleep.\n\nNOTIFICATIONS\nYou can configure notifications for the following scenarios. \n - When heart rate exceeds a bpm value. \n - When heart rate drops below a bpm value. \n - A daily reminder to check how you've gone today. \n\nNOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR HEALTH\nHeart Watch is very useful tool to get alerted about any possible health issues in a concise format that you can show your medical practitioner.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nThis app requires an iPhone that has the Health App installed. Heart readings are read from the Health Data Store which is ideally populated by your Apple Watch. You can also import heart rate readings from other sources and devices.",

The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n\u2022  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n\u2022  Option to resume capture \n\u2022  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n\u2022  Innovative 'Freeze'  and \u2018Blur Strength\u2019 controls\n\u2022  Tap to adjust focus\/exposure\n\u2022  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n\u2022  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n\u2022  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

For clarity, add structure with headings. Then group your projects by areas of responsibility, such as \u201cFamily\u201d, \u201cWork\u201d, or \u201cHealth\u201d. Review these regularly to stay on top of things.\n\n3. Plan Your Time\nSee your calendar events alongside your to-dos and plan your time effectively. Create repeating to-dos for things you do every few days, weeks, or months \u2013 Things will remind you on the right day.\n\n4. Make the Most of Your Day\nEvery morning, grab a coffee and prepare your list for \u201cToday\u201d: review previously planned to-dos and make quick decisions on what to tackle. Pick some more steps from your projects and then get going. The Today list is the only place you\u2019ll need to look for the rest of the day.\n\n5. Customize Your Workflow\nUse tags to categorize your to-dos or add context. For example, tag places like \u201cOffice\u201d or \u201cHome\u201d, or tag all your \u201cErrands\u201d, or everything you\u2019re working on with \u201cKate\u201d. You can easily find everything you\u2019ve tagged via filtering or search.\n\n\nHERE'S WHY WE THINK YOU'LL LOVE THINGS\n\n1. It stays out of your way.\nAs you start using Things, you\u2019ll quickly notice how seamlessly all the features fit together to give you an uncluttered, focused experience. There are no unnecessary frills. No pointless gimmicks or useless controls. In fact, you\u2019ll hardly notice the app \u2013 it\u2019s just you and your to-dos.\n\n2. Everything revolves around your to-dos.\nIn Things, each of your to-dos are special. In a list, they simply show a checkbox and the title of your to-do. But when you open them, they extend into a beautiful white piece of paper that\u2019s ready to hold your thoughts. Additional details (checklists, tags, reminders, deadline) are nicely tucked away in the corner until you need them.\n\n3. It\u2019s got a touch of magic.\nThings removes friction in magical ways. Take the new Magic Plus Button that lets you insert to-dos at any place in a list \u2013 simply via drag and drop. Or the ease at which you can multi-select and operate on many to-dos at once. Or the natural language date parser: just type \u201ctomorrow\u201d, \u201cin 4 days\", or \u201cnext Wednesday\", and it will jump to all the right conclusions.\n\n4. It\u2019s got all the power of iOS.\nThings is fully integrated with all the latest iOS technologies: Apple Watch, Calendars, Siri & Reminders, Today Widget, Quick Actions, Action Extension, Handoff, and Notifications.\n\n5. And much more...\nEveryone's got their favorite feature, it's impossible to list them all. See what our users love about Things \u2013 visit our website at: thingsapp.com\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEW?\n\nThis is a truly incredible update, with dozens of powerful new features. See the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d section below for a full list.\n\n\nTHINGS FOR ALL YOUR DEVICES\n\nGet Things for Mac and iPad to enjoy the full power of Things across your devices (sold separately). The apps all stay updated via Things Cloud \u2013 the push sync service that we custom-built for Things.\n\n\nQUESTIONS?\n\nIf you have any questions, or run into any trouble \u2013 please contact us. We provide world-class, professional support for Things, and we\u2019ll be glad to help you.",

			"TBAppDescription": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations that were added with LaTeX in the desktop software, and ruby text above Asian languages.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nPlease also note that while you can use almost any language on your cards, AnkiMobile's user interface is only available in English at the moment.\n\nAside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see http:\/\/www.apple.com\/itunes\/education\/\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: http:\/\/ankisrs.net\/docs\/AnkiMobile.html\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

You don't have to study all 3,400+ questions but they are there for you if you want.  \n2. CAN YOU GRADE YOURSELF?  Seriously!  Many board apps don't even allow you to grade yourself.  You can't look at your test scores for each subject because they don't even keep score.\n3. Does it have an advanced learn engine that tracks questions seen\/unseen, answered correctly\/incorrectly, and then dynamically creates your tests accordingly?\n4. Does it provide BOTH a casual study mode AND a test mode?\n5. Does it provide AUDIO questions?\n6. Are you able to SEE your study and test PROGRESS for ALL lessons at a MERE GLANCE?\n8. Can you customize your tests with adjustable question counts and subjects?\n9. Does it allow you to add your own unit study documents and files to the app?  Most units have unique study requirements such as unit history.  This app allows you to easily add those documents directly into the app.\n\nThis is a comprehensive guide addressing the common Army promotion board topics - over 40 subjects. Information was taken directly from Army regulations, Army doctrine reference publications (ADRPs), Army doctrine publications (ADPs), field manuals, technical manuals, training circulars, and pamphlets. All the study material is in question\/ answer\/ flashcard format. Hyperlinks are used in the larger sections to help better facilitate the blocks of information. In addition, to help support some of the question\/answers, notes are provided throughout along with Helpful Hints to aid in memory recall. \n\nForceReadiness.com is not affiliated with the US Army.
