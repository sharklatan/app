Even if you haven\u2019t opened the app in days, Dark Sky will tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it. \n\nTODAY WIDGET\nThe Dark Sky Notification Center Widget tells you at a glance what\u2019s going to happen in the next hour and the next week, so you don\u2019t even have to unlock your phone to quickly check the weather before heading out.\n\nTIME MACHINE\nExplore weather in the past or future.

As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nA handy Today Widget lets you see how your own \"batteries\" are charged for last night and the previous seven days. A second (entirely optional) widget lets you also track the time you have taken to fall asleep.\n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 3.2 or higher. WatchOS 4.2 recommended.",

You don't need a computers and expensive software to superimpose or blend\/mix\/combine\/cut\/copy\/paste one photo on top of another any more.\n\nHere is how it works...\n\n1. Load a background image.\n2. Load a foreground image.\n3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.\n4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.\n5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.\n6. Adjust the colors\/exposure\/contrast\/hue\/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.\n7. You are done! Save the blended image to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYou can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.\n\nMasking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, polygon, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear, radial gradient, mask from image, mask from text, magic mask and hair refine masking tools. Mask an area with this tool and that area of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.\n\nYou can even drop a shadow of the foreground onto the background.",

		"TBAppDescription": "*** APPLE DESIGN AWARD WINNER 2017 ***\n\nMeet the all-new Things! A complete rethinking of the original, award-winning task manager \u2013 with a perfect balance between simplicity and power, incredible new features, delightful interactions, and a timeless new design.\n\n\nHERE'S HOW THINGS WORKS\n\nIf you're new to Things, this is the basic workflow:\n\n1. Collect Your Thoughts\nGet things off your mind quickly with Things\u2019 action extension \u2013 it lets you create to-dos from other apps. Or just talk to Siri on any device (\u201cRemind me to...\u201d) and import from Reminders.\n\n2. Get Organized\nCreate a project for each of your goals, then add the steps to reach them. For clarity, add structure with headings. Then group your projects by areas of responsibility, such as \u201cFamily\u201d, \u201cWork\u201d, or \u201cHealth\u201d. Review these regularly to stay on top of things.\n\n3. Plan Your Time\nSee your calendar events alongside your to-dos and plan your time effectively. Create repeating to-dos for things you do every few days, weeks, or months \u2013 Things will remind you on the right day.\n\n4. Make the Most of Your Day\nEvery morning, grab a coffee and prepare your list for \u201cToday\u201d: review previously planned to-dos and make quick decisions on what to tackle. Pick some more steps from your projects and then get going. The Today list is the only place you\u2019ll need to look for the rest of the day.\n\n5. Customize Your Workflow\nUse tags to categorize your to-dos or add context. For example, tag places like \u201cOffice\u201d or \u201cHome\u201d, or tag all your \u201cErrands\u201d, or everything you\u2019re working on with \u201cKate\u201d. You can easily find everything you\u2019ve tagged via filtering or search.\n\n\nHERE'S WHY WE THINK YOU'LL LOVE THINGS\n\n1. It stays out of your way.\nAs you start using Things, you\u2019ll quickly notice how seamlessly all the features fit together to give you an uncluttered, focused experience. There are no unnecessary frills. No pointless gimmicks or useless controls. In fact, you\u2019ll hardly notice the app \u2013 it\u2019s just you and your to-dos.\n\n2. Everything revolves around your to-dos.\nIn Things, each of your to-dos are special. In a list, they simply show a checkbox and the title of your to-do. But when you open them, they extend into a beautiful white piece of paper that\u2019s ready to hold your thoughts. Additional details (checklists, tags, reminders, deadline) are nicely tucked away in the corner until you need them.\n\n3. It\u2019s got a touch of magic.\nThings removes friction in magical ways. Take the new Magic Plus Button that lets you insert to-dos at any place in a list \u2013 simply via drag and drop. Or the ease at which you can multi-select and operate on many to-dos at once. Or the natural language date parser: just type \u201ctomorrow\u201d, \u201cin 4 days\", or \u201cnext Wednesday\", and it will jump to all the right conclusions.\n\n4. It\u2019s got all the power of iOS.\nThings is fully integrated with all the latest iOS technologies: Apple Watch, Calendars, Siri & Reminders, Today Widget, Quick Actions, Action Extension, Handoff, and Notifications.\n\n5. And much more...\nEveryone's got their favorite feature, it's impossible to list them all. See what our users love about Things \u2013 visit our website at: thingsapp.com\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEW?\n\nThis is a truly incredible update, with dozens of powerful new features. See the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d section below for a full list.\n\n\nTHINGS FOR ALL YOUR DEVICES\n\nGet Things for Mac and iPad to enjoy the full power of Things across your devices (sold separately). The apps all stay updated via Things Cloud \u2013 the push sync service that we custom-built for Things.\n\n\nQUESTIONS?\n\nIf you have any questions, or run into any trouble \u2013 please contact us. We provide world-class, professional support for Things, and we\u2019ll be glad to help you.",

		"TBAppDescription": "\"HeartWatch is so good, you\u2019d think Apple built the app itself.\" John Patrick Pullen, Time Magazine. Top 5 in Health & Fitness in 63 countries. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n*IMPORTANT* \nHeartWatch 3 requires iOS 10 or iOS 11. Watch OS 3 or Watch OS 4.\nIf you are missing the Watch App or Experiencing crash on restart, please press the Review tab and click on App Support. This explains what you need to do! Please email us if you are stuck. We love to help. \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nYour Apple Watch is a highly sophisticated instrument, measuring and capturing your heart rate data throughout the day.\n\nHeartWatch lets you see how your heart is beating across four simple views. Waking, Regular, Workout & Sleeping. Each of these views are isolated because, while you may want a higher heart rate during a workout, if your heart is racing when you aren't doing any exercise then this is likely not a good thing and probably something you might want to show your medical practitioner. \n\nHeartWatch gives you an easy solution to this. It accesses your heart rate & workout readings created by your Apple Watch and unlocks the power of this information in a simple, intuitive way. \n\nINTRODUCING HEART BADGES\nHeartWatch 2 introduces heart badges. These are a simple glanceable graphic that lets you quickly see how your heart is doing for different types of events. The colours represent time in zones overlayed with an average. \n\nFor regular* heart rate readings, the ideal is to have a completely blue badge. The bigger the red ring around the badge, the more time spent with an elevated heart rate. Even though averages can appear to be similar, the badge shows a clear picture of how your heart has really been tracking and alerts you about excessively high or low readings. \n\nFor workouts, you can easily see the zonal makeup of your workout at a glance.\n\n*regular: time spent not sleeping nor working out.\n\nAN INTELLIGENT COMPLICATION\nThe complication displays the last heart rate reading captured by your watch. \n\nA FAST, EASY TO USE WATCH APP\nAn instant background update has you seeing your latest heart rate and a summary of your day. You can take your \"live\" pulse at any time by tapping the Pulse gauge. You can start a workout directly in the app and get live updates on your heart rate zone. You can also track sleep and add measurements & notes. \n\nAMAZING NAVIGATION\nWhether you are looking for heart rate irregularities or checking on your workout progress, HeartWatch makes things very easy via a 12 week big picture. Find out exactly what your heart was doing throughout your day. The addition of an energy overlay to the regular heart rate detail view means you can determine if those peaks you sometimes get are more likely due to stress or increased activity. \n\nCAPTURE HEALTH & SLEEP DATA\nCapture key HealthKit measurements just by saying them, take notes about your day and track sleep.\n\nNOTIFICATIONS\nYou can configure notifications for the following scenarios. \n - When heart rate exceeds a bpm value. \n - When heart rate drops below a bpm value. \n - A daily reminder to check how you've gone today. \n\nNOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR HEALTH\nHeart Watch is very useful tool to get alerted about any possible health issues in a concise format that you can show your medical practitioner.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nThis app requires an iPhone that has the Health App installed. Heart readings are read from the Health Data Store which is ideally populated by your Apple Watch. You can also import heart rate readings from other sources and devices.",

You can't look at your test scores for each subject because they don't even keep score.\n3. Does it have an advanced learn engine that tracks questions seen\/unseen, answered correctly\/incorrectly, and then dynamically creates your tests accordingly?\n4. Does it provide BOTH a casual study mode AND a test mode?\n5. Does it provide AUDIO questions?\n6. Are you able to SEE your study and test PROGRESS for ALL lessons at a MERE GLANCE?\n8. Can you customize your tests with adjustable question counts and subjects?\n9. Does it allow you to add your own unit study documents and files to the app?  Most units have unique study requirements such as unit history.  This app allows you to easily add those documents directly into the app.\n\nThis is a comprehensive guide addressing the common Army promotion board topics - over 40 subjects. Information was taken directly from Army regulations, Army doctrine reference publications (ADRPs), Army doctrine publications (ADPs), field manuals, technical manuals, training circulars, and pamphlets. All the study material is in question\/ answer\/ flashcard format. Hyperlinks are used in the larger sections to help better facilitate the blocks of information. In addition, to help support some of the question\/answers, notes are provided throughout along with Helpful Hints to aid in memory recall. \n\nForceReadiness.com is not affiliated with the US Army.

		"TBAppDescription": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations that were added with LaTeX in the desktop software, and ruby text above Asian languages.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nPlease also note that while you can use almost any language on your cards, AnkiMobile's user interface is only available in English at the moment.\n\nAside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see http:\/\/www.apple.com\/itunes\/education\/\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: http:\/\/ankisrs.net\/docs\/AnkiMobile.html\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do! Enable manual mode; set the focus to infinity; change the temperature to a certain number; change the ISO between certain values; change the shutter speed to something else....wait what...?\n\nDon't worry, this app does all of that for you so all you have to do is find those lights.  ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

		"TBAppDescription": "KetoDiet App the original low-carb app from KetoDietApp.com\n\nKetoDiet is not just about losing weight at any cost; it's about adopting a healthier lifestyle. Apart from reducing your carbohydrate intake, you will learn why it\u2019s important to follow a whole foods based approach and include healthy fat sources like olive oil, fatty fish and pastured meat in your everyday diet. \n\nA healthy low-carb diet is an effective weight loss tool as it will keep your blood sugar level stable and your appetite under control. Apart from fat burning effects, a low-carbohydrate lifestyle can additionally improve health conditions including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and inflammation, all of which increase the risk of developing heart disease. \n\nThe ketogenic diet appears to be useful adjuvant to treatment for health conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type 2 Diabetes, epilepsy and even some types of cancer.\n\nHOW IS KETODIET BETTER THAN OTHER APPS?\n\n1.

More than two million people visit us every month. \n\n- Thousands have already joined our KetoDiet Challenges to stay motivated while following a healthy low carb diet.\n- Facebook support group to help you get started and answer any questions you may have.\n\nWHAT IS KETO?\n\nWhen you follow a ketogenic diet by reducing your carb intake to less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body will start producing ketones in the liver. You will enter ketosis and start using fat and ketone bodies as energy source. One of the main benefits of ketosis is its ability to suppress appetite. While your ketone levels will increase, your blood glucose levels and insulin levels will drop, leading to satiety. You will naturally eat less and the number of calories eaten will drop.\n\nKETODIET APP HIGHLIGHTS\n\nKETO RECIPES: \nKetoDiet includes 300 low-carb, paleo & primal recipes plus over 650 FREE recipes from our integrated keto blog.\n\n- Detailed and accurate nutritional facts\n- Optional ingredients offer more flexibility\n- Serving size adjustment\n- Favorite recipes to quickly find them\n\nPROFILE:\n- Set you carbohydrate limit and goals\n- Built-in Keto calculator to determine your ideal macronutrient intake\n- Update your weight, body fat & measurements to track your progress\n- Sign up for a free KetoDiet account to sync across multiple devices\n\nPLANNER\/TRACKER: \nPlan your keto meals with our intuitive diet planner.

		"TBAppDescription": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\n\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\n\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\n\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\n\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

If you have a newer device this shouldn't be a problem! \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game\u2019s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2018s is frightening. It\u2019s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It\u2019s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nThis game was created using Clickteam Fusion!",

Play with friends or strangers in online play, or play offline with friends face-to-face!\n\nExploding Kittens, the most-funded game in Kickstarter history, is now available for iOS.\n\nCreat\u200bed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\n\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\n\n- All art illustrated by The Oatmeal\n\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\n\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\n\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t\u200bhe game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.\n\n\n\n\n\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money. You must be at least 13 years old to download and play. There is also an option to compete online against strangers and resulting data transfer charges may apply.

		"TBAppDescription": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \n\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\n\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\n\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\n\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\n\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\n\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!",

You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan \u2013 but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan\u2019s new wealth! You\u2019ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario \u201cThe first Island\u201d\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don\u2019t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can\u2019t be automatically restored, we\u2019ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter \u201eCatanWarp*\u201c (* = 1\u201315) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1\u201315). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We\u2019re avid Catan players ourselves. We\u2019ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com\/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com\/USM_News \n\n*****",

Combine staff training with enemy battles, collected materials, and skill unlocks, to make your crafted weapons and equipment more and more powerful. \n \nThere are over 200 different pieces of gear and equipment to be crafted, with an equally impressive selection of over 200 skills. With skill combinations, you've got almost limitless options. \nThere's a huge selection of over 70 monsters, as well as a few giant bosses to conquer, in addition to over a hundred missions to complete. \n \nWe've also added some unique mechanics to the game. One example is having to lure bosses out of hiding, using food to entice them. Offer them something sweet, then destroy them.  \nWhen you craft different weapons and equipment, you'll notice that each one has its own attributes and skill bindings. The weapon crafting also has an element of luck, so you never know when you might just luck out and craft the perfect weapon.  \nAlso, what weapon crafting game would be complete without additional enchanting mechanics to further imbue your equipment with even more raw power.  \n \nIn addition to crafting and making money, you can also send your staff members on auto-battle journeys where they'll earn materials for you as they progress deeper and deeper into dungeons. You'll see your materials building up, but pay attention to the health of your staff. If you feel there's a chance they might die, you can run from battle at any time and keep any materials they've already earned from that journey.  \n \nWe hope, whatever you decide to do in the game, that you have a great time doing it.  \n \nSincerely, \nDigdog Studios Ltd.",

		"TBAppDescription": "#1 RPG in 10 countries so far!\n\nThis is the unofficial expanded version of Jason Rohrer's desktop game \"One Hour One Life\", adapted for iOS. We have added additional play modes as well as changes to make it play better on touchscreens. We are independent developers and the mobile game world resides on our servers. \n\nIf you have played the original game, you will recognize Jason's cute and quirky graphics and sounds, as well as the wonderful premise: rebuilding civilization from scratch, together with other players and across countless generations.\n\nYou are born either as a baby to one of the other players, or as a young woman if no suitable mother is found. Every minute of real time is one year in the game and your maximum age is 60 years. A single life is limited, but the things you make during your lifetime are left for your children and grandchildren once you are gone. Try to make life a little bit easier for those who come after you, so your family line will have a chance to prosper for generations to come.\n\nSometimes you will spawn alone in the wilderness. You need to build a fire to stay warm and trap rabbits to get meat and furs for clothes. A sharp stone may be your best friend in the beginning. Try to find a good spot to settle and grow some food, because other players may soon arrive as your children, and will need to be taken care of until they are grown enough to help you.\n\nSometimes you will be born in a sprawling city, with farmers, cooks, blacksmiths, shepherds and hunters. There will be clothes and equipment ready for you, prepared by players who may be your grandparents or distant relatives. Maybe you will gather some friends and set out to start a settlement of your own, maybe you will inherit a farm job from your uncle, or maybe you will slay bears and wolves. The choices are endless, but remember: unless you leave the world better after you have lived than when you arrived, you have not really achieved anything.\n\nEvery life you play will put you in contact with new players. Some are more experienced than you, some are less. Some will teach you and some will learn from you. Some may even be disruptive to the civilization you are building, and will need to be dealt with accordingly. It will be up to you and your fellow players to shape the world for a brief moment in time, before the following generations take over.\n\nAfter your game life is over, you can look at your family tree and see how your descendants are doing. You can take pride in each of your younger relatives who survives into adulthood and in each new generation that follows you, knowing that you helped make it happen.",

		"TBAppDescription": "This special \"VIP\" edition allows you to enjoy the hit prison sim at its best with no ads and full access to the editor! Create your own inmate and attempt to survive in a prison where every sentence is a \"death\" sentence. Rub shoulders with up to 100 fellow inmates in a sprawling facility of 12 unique areas, each filled with fully interactive furniture and props. Plus a life beyond the gates populated by real civilians, with wardens enforcing dozens of different laws to keep you as far away from it as possible.\n\nEach day, you will find your health and mental state slipping away. Both can be restored by sleeping - which is also a good way to pass time. You won't always be permitted to sleep, though, so consuming food and drink bridges the gap. These, along with many other activities such as reading or watching TV, can also help to improve your mental state. If you \"lose your mind\" you will temporarily lose control of your character - and will almost certainly get into trouble!\n\nYour character also has a set of attributes that you are challenged to improve:\n- STRENGTH indicates how much damage you can inflict or absorb. You can improve it by fighting or lifting weights.\n- AGILITY determines how fast you move. You can improve it by jogging in the yard or scoring baskets.\n- INTELLECT reflects your knowledge - including fighting skills such as counters. You can improve it by reading books.\n- REPUTATION is how much other prisoners respect you. It can be improved by accomplishing tasks or intimidating others.\n\nThere are also opportunities to earn money - whether you work for it with a broom, trade items at a profit, or run with a gang. Having money increases your opportunities to grease the wheels and make your life inside easier.\n\nYou may find that you need to go to the toilet from time to time, in which case you must race to the bathroom! Alternatively, you could find a toilet to sit on or grab some toilet paper to spare your blushes. Failing to do so will damage your reputation and mental state.\n\nI regret that there is more to this game than I could ever explain here, so I hope you enjoy figuring some things out for yourself!\n\nBASIC CONTROLS:\n(*Look out for tutorials within the actual game)\nA = Attack (on its own to kick, with a direction to punch)\nG = Grapple \/ Throw weapon\nR = Run\nP = Pick-Up \/ Drop\nT = Taunt (interact with handheld props)\n\nOTHER CONTROLS\n- Press ATTACK and RUN together to launch a powerful attack.\n- Press any button with any direction (or none) in a grapple to trigger different moves.\n- Press RUN and PICK-UP together to set fire to a small object (which can then be used to set fire to a large object).\n- Touch the clock to pause the game and bring up options to exit.\n- Touch any speech bubble to speed through conversations.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n- If you find your device struggles to display lots of characters, considering keeping the \"Population\" option low.\n- \"Speed Up Frame Rate\" sleeping will require good performance at the default frame rate.\n- Head to the \"Display\" options to tone down other features.",

This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his struggle against the criminal elements of the galaxy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t your ordinary dual-stick shooter. The emphasis is on tactical combat and stealth, rather than just spraying bullets, and there\u2019s a story! \n\nTACTICAL COMBAT\nUse the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, drones, gun turrets, proximity mines and much more\u2026\n\nSTEALTH\nChoose your approach carefully. Some say running into the fray, guns blazing, isn\u2019t always the answer. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use stealth takedowns and silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers. Hack gun turrets to turn on their masters. Lure different enemy factions together and let them fight each other.\n\nLOAD-OUT & GEAR\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon - and there\u2019s something for everyone.

		"TBAppDescription": "If you had the power, how would you create the solar system? What would be the size of each planet or star? And how would you place them in orbit? If you are interested in Astronomy and looking for a powerful yet easy to use 3 dimensional space sand box app to create and simulate a whole new galaxy with realistic physics rules, then you\u2019ve come to the right place. Orbit Sandbox Universe, the 3D sand box game, provides you the ultimate power to explore the infinite space and simulate your own space full of different planets, gas giants, and stars. \n\nIn this gravity simulator app, you get to customize literally any aspect of these particles to simulate and design your very own solar system in this sand box. Once you are satisfied with your customized solar system (or any other combination of particles, planets, and stars), you get to easily add it to your collection, take a screenshot and share it with the world.\nThe game comes with a clean and neat design and the 3D simulation is so smooth that you won\u2019t feel any difficulties or lags when bombarding your planets, or applying any condition to them. And make sure not to take the realistic gravity lensing effect as granted when looking at a black hole. It\u2019s just fascinating. \n\nIs this Orbit Sandbox Easy to Use?\nIs this 3D galaxy sand box with realistic physics simulation powerful enough to create and design different planets, gas giants and stars? The answer is a BIG yes! But are the simulation tools easy to use? The answer is even a BIGGER yes! The user interface is so friendly, that you\u2019ll get used to it after going through the step-by-step tutorial and trying available tools for a few times. After that, you just need to use your imagination and be creative to form some unique pocket galaxies with gravity simulator based on physics rules. If you are going to redesign our lovely solar system in our galaxy, you\u2019ll have access to all the planets (mars, moon, earth, mercury etc \u2026) and you have the power to unlock new worlds by meeting the right conditions, colliding with the right objects, and altering mass and sea level while keeping the temperature stable. To smash stuff together and create new planets, make sure to crash the right ones together. \nTip: To raise the sea level, hit a planet with ice meteors, and use rock meteors to lower the sea level. \nOrbit Sandbox Main Features at a Glance:\n\u2022\tWonderful 3D graphics with smooth space simulation\n\u2022\tSuper user-friendly interface with easy to learn gameplay\n\u2022\tStep-by-step and detailed tutorial\n\u2022\tHuge variety of particles, procedural planets, gas giants and stars\n\u2022\tUltimate customization options for your creations\n\u2022\tGravity simulator with realistic physics rules\n\u2022\tCreate Solar System with the tiniest details \n\u2022\tTake screenshots of your universe and share it with family and friends\n\u2022\tUnlock new achievements\n\u2022\tInteractive journal to track your creations\n\u2022\tSave and Load simulated creations\nSo, Orbit Sandbox Universe offers everything you should expect from such 3D gravity and universe sandbox games and it even sets the bar to a higher level by offering smooth particle simulator, realistic physics rules, user-friendly interface, a wide range of different particles, planets and stars, and a lot more.\nNo matter you are serious in Astronomy stuff or you just want to have fun creating some beautiful infinite universes, we\u2019ve got you covered. You just need to take your time, select from wide range of stunning particles, stars, and planets, specify their positions and how they should rotate, and last but not the least decide which planets should collide to destroy and create new worlds. \nDownload and let us know about any bugs, feature requests or any other suggestions.\n\nThe app formerly known as Pocket Universe.",

		"TBAppDescription": "This is a classical sliding puzzle game for all puzzle game lovers. It consists of a puzzle that has been divided in N x N tiles that have been shuffled. One tile is taken out and the tiles are shuffled. The objective is to move the tiles using the empty tile space in a specific sequence to rearrange the puzzle into its correct original order. This application allows the user to pick among several puzzle images, the number of tiles(3x3, 4x4 or 5x5) and four difficulty levels(easy, medium,hard and no time limit). \n\nThe handling of the Sliding Puzzle is simple. Choose a picture from the sample pictures provided with this app or even can choose an image from your PHOTO LIBRARY or CAMERA and start the mixing of the puzzle pieces with the \"Start\" button. If the puzzle module has finished the shuffling of the pieces, you can start with the solving of the puzzle. \n\nTo rearrange the pieces, just click on a tile or simply swipe to slide it to the empty place. You can restart the slide puzzle at any time. You can set the difficulty level by going to the menu screen and selecting the \"Game modes\" option. At anytime you can restart the puzzle using the same puzzle settings by clicking the Reset button just underneath the main puzzle. \nYou can also enable or disable application audio anytime from the main menu. \n\nThe application keeps track of the total number of moves made and the total amount of time taken to complete the puzzle. \n\nYou can compare the puzzle with the reference small image at the bottom left(just underneath the main puzzle)of the screen. The faster and the fewer moves you make, the higher your score. Anytime the puzzle game is paused (back button or home button pressed or another application interrupts the current puzzle), the order of the puzzle as well as the progress so far is retained. Whenever you launch the puzzle application again, you will resume exactly where you stopped with the same order and number of moves. Every time you complete the puzzle and you achieve a high score, you are eligible to add it to the top scores also accessible via the \"High Score\" option. \n\n\nFeatures include: \n\n1) Number of movements are recorded and the timer is on-so, you will have an idea about the number of steps and the time taken by you to complete the puzzle. \n\n2) Four difficulty levels : easy, medium, hard and no time limit. \n\n3) Number of tiles : 3x3, 4x4 or 5x5. \n\n4) You can view your top score anytime. \n\n5) Clean animations.\n\n6) You can also enable or disable application audio or tiles number anytime from the main menu. \n\n7) Solver to solve every puzzle for you!\n\n8) Last but not the least, you can choose the images from these three sources and make that image as your puzzle image : - \n\n* Images provided with this app \n\n* PHOTO LIBRARY \n\n* CAMERA \n\n\nOverall this is a great time killer and a good brain exercise. I hope you enjoy it!!",

It takes the different levels of players into account; obstacles are based on the music beat, which deepen your inner resonance.\n\nDirector Profile\nBefore making LONER, I was a game programmer, and really wanted to make a game with my own style. The original idea is to make a 3D version \"Flappy Bird\" with a different perspective, but in the production process, I suddenly found that the game has a quiet loneliness: A plane flies slowly alone in the dark channel by passing one after another obstacle, but seems never reach the end of channel, which is slight shiny in the distance. In the influence of some literary and artistic works, I have been very interested in loneliness, and there are rarely games which express mainly the lonely sense in the market, so that the game topic is decided as this. \nAs a programmer who begins to learn art, I understand that to create roles and environment with rich details in short time is unrealistic, so I decide to pay a tribute to the art style of the \"2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d, and this style features \"Loner\" that the entire scene tones can be arbitrarily transformed.\n\nBGM List\n1.Deepsea\n2.Sea Sand \n3.Time \n4.Tunnel\n5.Voices \n6.Void",

		"TBAppDescription": "Note reading made fun! Note Rush is a game for practising note reading on the music staff to help you learn to play the piano, keyboard, flute, saxophone, violin... you name it! Note Rush shows you one note at a time in random order then uses the microphone to listen as you play through them like you would with note reading flash cards, only these flash cards check that you're playing the right note! \n\nPlay with a bunch of fun themes and race to earn stars and beat your best time! Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting. I'm thankful he can do this on his own and it keeps track of his high scores which is highly motivating for him.\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"A blockbuster hit with teachers and students... I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com\/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students learn how notes are spaced out\u00a0across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher.",

Innovations included the ability to play all the main characters as the game's protagonist, and to this day, its epic story intertwining each of their fates is still highly rated and wildly popular. The characters' dramatic performances are also highly rated, including the catastrophe occurring midway through, which delivers a particular emotional jolt to players.\n\nWith plenty of abilities available and the magicite system for controlling spells\/summoning, players can develop their characters any way they want. This was also the first FINAL FANTASY game to include the Ultima Weapon, the most powerful sword of all and a recurring item in subsequent titles within the series.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\u2022 Game data saved with iCloud can now be shared across devices!

The battle interface has received particular attention, with a complete overhaul for use on your smartphone.\n\n\u2022 This smartphone release includes the new magicites and events that were introduced in the 2006 remake.\n\n\u2022 Some events have been optimized to be played with user-friendly touch controls.\n\n\nStory\nThe War of Magi left little but ashes and misery in its wake. Even magic itself had vanished from the world. Now, a thousand years later, humankind has remade the world through the power of iron, gunpowder, steam engines, and other machines and technologies.\n\nBut there is one who possesses the lost power of magic--a young girl name Terra whom the evil Empire has kept enslaved in an effort to harness her power as weapon. This leads to a fateful meeting between Terra and a young man named Locke. Their harrowing escape from the Empire's clutches sets in motion a series of events that touches countless lives and leads to one inevitable conclusion.\n\n*****************************\nRecommended Devices:\n- iPhone 4S or later\n- iPad 2 or later\n\nCertain in-game conditions may cause the app to close unexpectedly on iPhone 4.
